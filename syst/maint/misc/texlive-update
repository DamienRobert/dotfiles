#vim: set ft=conf
#after an update of texlive
sudo texhash /etc/texmf
sudo fmtutil-sys --all
sudo updmap-sys
luaotfload-tool -u
#note: it should not be necessary to update luaotf database, it should do
#it automatically, but in the last update on Numenor, using lualatex
#slides.tex il would not work: the database would be regenerated but not
#written (permission problem?) so it would regenerate the database at each
#font access...
#texhash /etc/texmf: on Doriath I was missing updmap.cfg...
