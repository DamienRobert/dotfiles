# Dotfiles

This repository contain dotfiles files and custom scripts.

- bin: symlinks to scripts that I use often, in my `PATH`. Some symlinks
  are broken here because they reference programs available in my other
  github repositories.
- config: dotfiles
- doc: notes on several things (maths, git, ruby, ...)
- ruby: custom ruby library
- script: custom scripts
- syst: scripts to administrate my [archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
  computers.

Some of the files are not complete since I have removed (most of) my
personal information.

Unfortunately there is no License information because some of the script
are copy pasted from the web and I am not the copyright owner. As far as I
am concerned, everything I wrote in this repository is under the MIT
license. I try to give links when I use code written by other people but I
can not guaranty this is always the case.

Anyway I view this repository as a way for people to find some examples of
config files and quick and dirty scripts. I doubt this will be interesting
to many people! The most interesting files are probably those in
script/git. For more concrete programs, look at my other github
repositories.
