Reactor expand into mine
========================

1 rax gas (@15) reactor (@2 rines)
cc, fact
supply at 22
mine + startport
2nd gas
-> two mines:
bunker + 2 raxes, tech lab on fact+starport, switch with raxes
ebay
reactor on fact (switch with starport)
turret, third gas then fourth
third cc, two raxes (total 5)
Two more raxes

1 Rax reaper expand

    10 – Supply Depot
    12 – Barracks
    12 – Refinery
    15 – Reaper
    16 – Orbital Command
    17 – After first 100 Gas is mined, stop mining all gas
    17 – @100% Reaper, start Reactor on Barracks
    17 – @400 Mins, start 2nd Command Center
    18 – Supply Depot
    19 – 2nd Barracks
    20 – Bunker, and put 3 SCVs back in the Refinery
    @100% 2nd Barracks, start Tech lab
    @100% Tech lab, start Stimpack Research
    @100 Gas, start Factory, Engineering Bay, and 2nd Refinery
    @100% Engineering Bay, start +1 Infantry Attack and 3rd Refinery
    @100% Factory, start Starport, Reactor on Factory, and 4th Refinery
    Benchmark: When you start your Starport (@7:50ish), you should be at 35 SCVs and around 60 supply.
    @100% Starport, swap off onto Factory’s Reactor, start 3 more Barracks, and start double Medivac production
(Note: add one barrack at the same time as starport, then 2 more rax)
    @100% Stimpack, start Combat Shields Research and begin Marauder production
    @100% 3rd Barracks, start Tech lab
    @100% 4th/5th Barracks, start Tech lab and Reactor
    @100% +1 Infantry Attack, start +1 Infantry Armor
    @100% 2 Medivacs (@9:45ish), push out with 2 Medivacs, 2 Marauders, around 28 Marines, Stimpack, Combat Shields, and +1 Attack.

ForGG Mech push
===============
Reactor expand into mine initial bo
Switch reactor with fact,
Make raven and add two facts
(so 1 starport, 2 fact tech lab, 1 reactor fact)
Reactor fact: makes =~6-8 mines then hellions
Tech lab fact: tank + hellbat research + mine research
(as sound as armory done)
Push when +1 and these 2 upgrades finishes

Reactor expand build
1 rax gas (@15) reactor (@2 rines)
cc, *2nd gas (@20)*, fact (@21)
starport+armory (@28)
swap rax and fact, rax -> techlab -> stim (+ marauders)
two mines -> hellbat, starport -> medivac, do a 2 hellbats drop
continue hellbat drops (don't lose medivacs!)
ebay (@50% stim) -> +1
push (@stim done, 10:00) with 10 scvs, 4 or so medivacs, 6-8 hellbats, 8 marines, 4 or so marauders
meanwhile: add third cc, take 2gas at nat, reactor on starport, add two rax (one on reactor from fact)

Another mech all in TvP
=======================

reactor expand (13gas) (1rine-> 1 reaper to scout)
fact -> reactor+armory -> 2 mines + hellbats
fact -> tech lab
fact -> switch with reactor from rax
starport -> switch with reactor from rax
fact -> tech lab
=> 2 reactor fact, 2 tech lab fact, 1 reactor starport
