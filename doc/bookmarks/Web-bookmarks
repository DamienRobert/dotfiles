Cheating on a string theory exam (codes)
 Pick 5400 23-bit vectors (the answers you will write) and your friend picks the one that minimizes its Hamming distance to the true answer.
    5400*23 + 5400*23*22/2 < 2**23
so answering 21 questions with certainty is impossible. (Pick the true answers so as to maximize the Hamming distance between it and whatever answer you decide to write, regardless of the scheme used.)
And there is a size 4096 < 5400 covering code [1] so answering 20 question is possible (by picking the 23-bit vectors in that code).

Off the top of my head, I can think of three such articles that stick out - their long treatment of the deepwater horizon accident and the chemical dispersants that were used in the cleanup, their decade-after-the-fact retrospective article on Gore vs. Bush, and a more recent article on the police officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO.
