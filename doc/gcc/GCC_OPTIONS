Je pense que je dirais plus vite qu'il faut compiler avec -O2. En
particulier pour les warnings, puisque le compilo fait une analyse plus
poussee, et que donc la qualite des diagnostics en -Wall -W -O2 est
notablement meilleure qu'en -O0.

-Wwrite-strings -Wcast-qual -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes

-Wwrite-strings
         When compiling C, give string constants the type "const
         char[length]" so that copying the address of one into a
         non-"const" "char *" pointer will get a warning; when
         compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from
         string constants to "char *".  These warnings will help
         you find at compile time code that can try to write into
         a string constant, but only if you have been very care
         ful about using "const" in declarations and prototypes.
         Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this is why we
         did not make -Wall request these warnings.
 -Wcast-qual
         Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type
         qualifier from the target type.  For example, warn if a
         "const char *" is cast to an ordinary "char *".
 -Wpointer-arith
         Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a
         function type or of "void".  GNU C assigns these types a
         size of 1, for convenience in calculations with "void *"
         pointers and pointers to functions.
         (implied by -Wpedentic)
 -Wstrict-prototypes (C only)
         Warn if a function is declared or defined without speci
         fying the argument types.  (An old-style function defi
         nition is permitted without a warning if preceded by a
         declaration which specifies the argument types.)

Optimisations:
-march -> compiler pour cette archi
-mtune -> optimiser pour cette archi

cpu: pentium4, amd64
------------------------------------------------------
-O
     -O1 Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more
         time, and a lot more memory for a large function.

         With -O, the compiler tries to reduce code size and exe
         cution time, without performing any optimizations that
         take a great deal of compilation time.

         -O turns on the following optimization flags: -fde
         fer-pop -fmerge-constants -fthread-jumps -floop-optimize
         -fif-conversion -fif-conversion2 -fdelayed-branch
         -fguess-branch-probability -fcprop-registers

         -O also turns on -fomit-frame-pointer on machines where
         doing so does not interfere with debugging.

     -O2 Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported
         optimizations that do not involve a space-speed trade
         off.  The compiler does not perform loop unrolling or
         function inlining when you specify -O2.  As compared to
         -O, this option increases both compilation time and the
         performance of the generated code.

         -O2 turns on all optimization flags specified by -O.  It
         also turns on the following optimization flags:
         -fforce-mem -foptimize-sibling-calls -fstrength-reduce
         -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks -fre
         run-cse-after-loop  -frerun-loop-opt -fgcse  -fgcse-lm
         -fgcse-sm  -fgcse-las -fdelete-null-pointer-checks -fex
         pensive-optimizations -fregmove -fschedule-insns
         -fschedule-insns2 -fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec
         -fcaller-saves -fpeephole2 -freorder-blocks  -fre
         order-functions -fstrict-aliasing -funit-at-a-time
         -falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-loops
         -falign-labels -fcrossjumping

         Please note the warning under -fgcse about invoking -O2
         on programs that use computed gotos.

     -O3 Optimize yet more.  -O3 turns on all optimizations spec
         ified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions,
         -fweb and -frename-registers options.

-fomit-frame-pointer
         Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions
         that don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to
         save, set up and restore frame pointers; it also makes
         an extra register available in many functions.  It also
         makes debugging impossible on some machines.
  (active avec -O sur certaines machines)
-finline-functions
         Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The
         compiler heuristically decides which functions are sim
         ple enough to be worth integrating in this way.

         If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
         function is declared "static", then the function is nor
         mally not output as assembler code in its own right.

 Unreliable arithmetic
----------------------------------------------------------------
 -ffast-math
         Sets -fno-math-errno, -funsafe-math-optimizations,
         -fno-trapping-math, -ffinite-math-only, -fno-round
         ing-math and -fno-signaling-nans.

         This option causes the preprocessor macro
         "__FAST_MATH__" to be defined.

         This option should never be turned on by any -O option
         since it can result in incorrect output for programs
         which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
         rules/specifications for math functions.

     -fno-math-errno
         Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are
         executed with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A pro
         gram that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error han
         dling may want to use this flag for speed while main
         taining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

         This option should never be turned on by any -O option
         since it can result in incorrect output for programs
         which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
         rules/specifications for math functions.

         The default is -fmath-errno.

     -funsafe-math-optimizations
         Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that
         (a) assume that arguments and results are valid and (b)
         may violate IEEE or ANSI standards.  When used at
         link-time, it may include libraries or startup files
         that change the default FPU control word or other simi
         lar optimizations.

         This option should never be turned on by any -O option
         since it can result in incorrect output for programs
         which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
         rules/specifications for math functions.

         The default is -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations.

     -ffinite-math-only
         Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that
         assume that arguments and results are not NaNs or
         +-Infs.

         This option should never be turned on by any -O option
         since it can result in incorrect output for programs
         which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
         The default is -fno-finite-math-only.

     -fno-trapping-math
         Compile code assuming that floating-point operations
         cannot generate user-visible traps.  These traps include
         division by zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result
         and invalid operation.  This option implies -fno-signal
         ing-nans.  Setting this option may allow faster code if
         one relies on ``non-stop'' IEEE arithmetic, for example.

         This option should never be turned on by any -O option
         since it can result in incorrect output for programs
         which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
         rules/specifications for math functions.

         The default is -ftrapping-math.

     -frounding-math
         Disable transformations and optimizations that assume
         default floating point rounding behavior.  This is
         round-to-zero for all floating point to integer conver
         sions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
         truncations.  This option should be specified for pro
         grams that change the FP rounding mode dynamically, or
         that may be executed with a non-default rounding mode.
         This option disables constant folding of floating point
         expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
         rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are
         unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

         The default is -fno-rounding-math.

         This option is experimental and does not currently guar
         antee to disable all GCC optimizations that are affected
         by rounding mode.  Future versions of GCC may provide
         finer control of this setting using C99's "FENV_ACCESS"
         pragma.  This command line option will be used to spec
         ify the default state for "FENV_ACCESS".

     -fsignaling-nans
         Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may gen
         erate user-visible traps during floating-point opera
         tions.  Setting this option disables optimizations that
         may change the number of exceptions visible with signal
         ing NaNs.  This option implies -ftrapping-math.

         This option causes the preprocessor macro
         "__SUPPORT_SNAN__" to be defined.

         The default is -fno-signaling-nans.

         This option is experimental and does not currently guar
         antee to disable all GCC optimizations that affect sig
         naling NaN behavior.

--param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2"

-pipe pour ne pas utiliser de fichiers temporaires
-fstack-protector
    Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
    smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to
    functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that
    call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The
    guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked
    when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error message
    is printed and the program exits.
--param: ssp-buffer-size
               The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive
               stack smashing protection when -fstack-protection is used.

http://blog.tremily.us/posts/rpath/
https://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath

The dynamic linker of the GNU C Library and its derivative Embedded GLIBC implement a rather complicated algorithm for searching for shared libraries. The basic search order is:[1]
    - The (colon-separated) paths in the DT_RPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute does not exist.
    - The (colon-separated) paths in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, unless the executable is a setuid/setgid binary, in which case it is ignored. LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be overridden by calling the dynamic linker with the option --library-path (e.g. /lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path $HOME/mylibs myprogram).
    - The (colon-separated) paths in the DT_RUNPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if present.
    - Lookup based on the ldconfig cache file (often located at /etc/ld.so.cache) which contains a compiled list of candidate libraries previously found in the augmented library path (set by /etc/ld.so.conf). If, however, the binary was linked with the -z nodeflib linker option, libraries in the default library paths are skipped.
    - In the trusted default path /lib, and then /usr/lib. If the binary was linked with the -z nodeflib linker option, this step is skipped.
Notes:
    - The option --inhibit-rpath LIST of the dynamic linker instructs it to ignore DT_RPATH and DT_RUNPATH attributes of the object names in LIST.
    - Libraries specified by the environment variable LD_PRELOAD and then those listed in /etc/ld.so.preload are loaded before the search begins. A preload can thus be used to replace some (or all) of the requested library's normal functionalities, or it can simply be used to supply a library that would otherwise not be found.
    - Static libraries are searched and linked into the ELF file at link time and are not linked at run time.
The role of GNU ld
The GNU Linker (GNU ld) implements a feature which it calls "new-dtags": [2]
If the new-dtags feature is enabled in the linker (at run time using --enable-new-dtags), GNU ld, besides setting the DT_RPATH attribute, also sets the DT_RUNPATH attribute to the same string. At run time, if the dynamic linker finds a DT_RUNPATH attribute, it ignores the value of the DT_RPATH attribute, with the effect that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is checked next and the paths in the DT_RUNPATH attribute are only searched after it.
This means that in such configurations, the paths in LD_LIBRARY_PATH are searched before those given at link time using -rpath if --enable-new-dtags was active.
Instead of specifying the -rpath to the linker, the environment variable LD_RUN_PATH can be set to the same effect.
