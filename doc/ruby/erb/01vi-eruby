How to get syntax highlighting for a muttrc.erb (for instance) for eruby in
vi, by order of priority:

- #vim: set ft=eruby.muttrc
- In one of the first four lines, put
# eruby_subtype=muttrc
- If the subtype is given by an extension (like .sh), then call the file
  ploum.sh.erb 
- Finally it uses the variable
  g:eruby_default_subtype (set to "html" by default)
