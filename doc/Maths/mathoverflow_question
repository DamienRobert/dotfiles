What are the local properties of scheme preserved under global sections?

Let (P) be a property of rings. I call (P) local when (P) satisfy these two
conditions:
- if A is a ring satisfying (P), then the distinguished rings A_f also
  satisfy (P).
- If Spec A is covered by distinguished open Spec A_i with the A_i having
  (P), then A satisfy (P).

Now if (P) is local, then it is natural to extend the property (P) to
schemes by saying that a scheme X has property (P) iff for all open affines
Spec A of X, A has property (P).

By definition of locality, then
- a ring A satisfy (P) iff Spec A satisfy (P)
- a scheme X satisfy (P) iff X can be covered by affines open Spec A_i with
  A_i satisfying (P)

Likewise in the relative setting, local properties of morphisms of rings
allow to define a corresponding notion for morphisms of schemes.

[I have to point out that sometimes extending a local property (P) of rings
to schemes this way is called (locally P), and a scheme X is said to have
property (P) when X is locally P and satisfy some finiteness condition.
For instance X is noetherian when it is locally noetherian and
quasi-compact; a morphism is of finite presentation when it is locally of
finite presentation and quasi-compact + quasi-separated.]

Now while this is a standard construction explained in all textbooks, it is
harder to find references for what happen to the global section of non
affine open subschemes.

Indeed, if X has a local property (P), then an open scheme U has also
property (P), but Spec O_X(U) may not have (P) when U is not affine.

For instance:
- X is noetherian does not mean that each ring of sections O_X(U) is
  noetherian
  (An example is given by the union of two disjoints plane in projective
  space P^3_k
  cf http://sma.epfl.ch/~ojangure/nichtnoethersch.pdf)
- X is finitely generated (say over a field) does not mean that each
  ring of sections O_X(U) is finitely generated
  (Same example as above, see also http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/files/nonfg.pdf)
- X -> Spec A is flat does not mean that O_X(X) is flat over A.
  (cf http://mathoverflow.net/questions/65267/global-sections-of-flat-scheme-also-flat)

However there are properties that hold for sections over any open subschemes:
- If X is reduced, then for every open subscheme U, O_X(U) is reduced
- If X is integral, then for every open subscheme U, O_X(U) is integral

I am interested to what happen with other properties (P). I am also
interested to what happen in the relative case: if a morphism X->Y has
property (P), then does Spec_Y(X) -> Y also has (P)?
