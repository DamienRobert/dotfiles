Let f be an infinitely differentiable function on [0,1] and suppose that
for each x∈[0,1] there is an integer n∈N such that f^(n)(x)=0. Then does f
coincide on [0,1] with some polynomial? If yes then how.


The proof is by contradiction. Assume f is not a polynomial.

Consider the following closed sets:
Sn={x:f(n)(x)=0}
and
X={x:∀(a,b)∋x:f↾(a,b) is not a polynomial}.

It is clear that X is a non-empty closed set without isolated points.
Applying Baire category theorem to the covering {X∩Sn} of X we get that
there exists an interval (a,b) such that (a,b)∩X is non-empty and
(a,b)∩X⊂Sn
for some n. Since every x∈(a,b)∩X is an accumulation point we also have
that x∈Sm for all m≥n and x∈(a,b)∩X.

Now consider any maximal interval (c,e)⊂((a,b)−X). Recall that f is a
polynomial of some degree d on (c,e). Therefore f(d)=const≠0 on [c,e].
Hence d<n. (Since either c or e is in X.)

So we get that f(n)=0 on (a,b) which is in contradiction with (a,b)∩X being
non-empty.
