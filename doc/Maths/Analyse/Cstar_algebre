C*-algèbres de dim finie = somme directe d'algèbres de matrices:
  Theorem. A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, A, is canonically isomorphic
  to a finite direct sum A = ⨁ {e ∈ min A} Ae
  where min A is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint
  central projections of A.

  Each C*-algebra, Ae, is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix
  algebra M(dim(e), C). The finite family indexed on min A given by {dim(e)}_e
  is called the dimension vector of A. This vector uniquely determines the
  isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of
  K-theory, this vector is the positive cone of the K0 group of A. 

C*-algèbres commutatives
========================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfand_representation
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gelfand+duality

For any locally compact Hausdorff topological space X, the space C0(X) of
continuous complex-valued functions on X which vanish at infinity is in a
natural way a commutative C*-algebra.
Note that C0(X) is unital if and only if X is compact, in which case C0(X)
is equal to C(X), the algebra of all continuous complex-valued functions on
X.

A algèbre de Banach commutative, \Phi(A) ses caractères est Hausdorff loc.
compact pour la topo *-faible (et compact pour cette topologie ssi A a une
identité); le morphisme d'évaluation donne un morphisme continu A ->
C_0(\Phi(A)).

Si A a une unité, \Phi(A) est en bijection avec les idéaux maximaux de A
(Gelfand–Mazur theorem: a Banach algebra with unit over the complex numbers
in which every nonzero element is invertible is isometrically isomorphic to
the complex numbers; the theorem follows from the fact that the spectrum of
any element of a complex Banach algebra is nonempty)
As a consequence, the kernel of the Gelfand representation A → C0(ΦA) may
be identified with the Jacobson radical of A. Thus the Gelfand
representation is injective if and only if A is (Jacobson) semisimple.

Théorème: Let A be a commutative C*-algebra and let X be the spectrum of A. Let γ : A → C0(X) be the Gelfand representation defined above.
Theorem. The Gelfand map γ is an isometric *-isomorphism from A onto C0(X).

Ici le spectre X (=Gelfand space) de A représente les caractères de A.
"Note that spectrum is an overloaded word. It also refers to the spectrum
σ(x) of an element x of an algebra with unit 1, that is the set of complex
numbers r for which x - r 1 is not invertible in A. For unital C*-algebras,
the two notions are connected in the following way: σ(x) is the set of
complex numbers f(x) where f ranges over Gelfand space of A. Together with
the spectral radius formula, this shows that Â is a subset of the unit ball
of A* and as such can be given the relative weak-* topology"

Rem: If A is a separable C*-algebra, the weak-* topology is metrizable on
bounded subsets. Thus the spectrum of a separable commutative C*-algebra A
can be regarded as a metric space.

On a donc une anti-équivalence de catégorie entre 'C*-algebras with unit and unit-preserving continuous *-homomorphisms' et 'the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps', via A -> X=Spectre(A), X -> C_0(X).

Cette anti-équivalence vient de l'adjonction suivante (Brandenburg, Remark
3.4.6):
the functor C(−,C) from  topological spaces to the  dual  category of (involutive) C-algebras  which is left adjoint to the Gelfand spectrum Hom(−, C). The Theorem of Gelfand-Naimark states that this adjunction restricts to an equivalence of categories between compact Hausdorff spaces and the  dual category of unital commutative C∗-algebras.

C*-algèbre comme algèbre d'opérateurs
=====================================

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfand%E2%80%93Naimark_theorem
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gelfand-Naimark+theorem

The Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra A is
isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-algebra of bounded operators on a
Hilbert space.

Calcul holomorphe sur des opérateurs bornés
===========================================

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_functional_calculus

Si T est un opérateur borné, et f est analytique de rayon de convergence supérieur à ||T||, alors on peut définir f(T)=\sum a_i T^i.
Plus généralement on peut définir f(T) via l'intégrale de Cauchy:
  f(T)=1/2πi ∫_Γ f(ζ)/(ζ−T)dζ
qui sera bien définie si f n'a pas de pôles sur le spectre de T (par définition du spectre).

The mapping ζ → (ζ−T)^−1 is called the resolvent mapping of T, il est analytique en dehors du spectre de T. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvent_formalism

En fait on a besoin que f soit holomorphe sur un ouvert contenant le spectre
(compact), et pas seulement sur un chemin \Gamma, pour avoir (f_1f_2)(T)=f_1(T)
f_2(T). De plus si f_i -> f (uniformément sur les compacts), f_i(T) converge aussi.

Spectral mapping theorem: σ(f(T)) = f(σ(T)), où σ est le spectre.

Applications: Spectral projections, Invariant subspace decomposition

Extensions:
With stronger assumptions, when T is a normal operator acting on a Hilbert
space, the domain of the functional calculus can be broadened. When comparing
the two results, a rough analogy can be made with the relationship between the
spectral theorem for normal matrices and the Jordan canonical form. When T is a
normal operator, a continuous functional calculus can be obtained, that is, one
can evaluate f(T) with f being a continuous function defined on σ(T). Using the
machinery of measure theory, this can be extended to functions which are only
measurable (see Borel functional calculus). The Borel functional calculus
extends to unbounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space.

In slightly more abstract language, the holomorphic functional calculus can
be extended to any element of a Banach algebra, using essentially the same
arguments as above. Similarly, the continuous functional calculus holds for
normal elements in any C*-algebra and the measurable functional calculus
for normal elements in any von Neumann algebra. 

Calcul continu
--------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_functional_calculus
Theorem. Let x be a normal element of a C*-algebra A with an identity
element e. Then there is a unique mapping π : f → f(x) defined for a
continuous function f on the spectrum σ(x) of x, such that π is a
unit-preserving morphism of C*-algebras and π(1) = e and π(id) = x.

The proof of this fact is almost immediate from the Gelfand representation:
it suffices to assume A is the C*-algebra of continuous functions on some
compact space X and define π(f)=f∘x.
Uniqueness follows from application of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

In particular, this implies that bounded normal operators on a Hilbert
space have a continuous functional calculus.

Dualité espace/fonctions
========================

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Serre-Swan+theorem
- the category of finitely-generated projective R-modules is equivalent to the category of algebraic vector bundles
-  X Hausdorff compact space; the category of finitely generated projective modules over the continuous-function algebra C(X) is equivalent to the category of finite-rank vector bundles on X
- smooth Serre-Swan theorem: For X a smooth manifold with ℝ-algebra of smooth functions C^∞(X) there is an equivalence of categories between that of finite rank smooth vector bundles over X and finitely generated projective modules over C^∞(X)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Isbell+duality
Under the interpretation of presheaves as generalized spaces and copresheaves as generalized quantities modeled on C (Lawvere 86, see at space and quantity), Isbell duality is the archetype of the duality between geometry and algebra that permeates mathematics (such as Gelfand duality or the embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras.)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/embedding+of+smooth+manifolds+into+formal+duals+of+R-algebras
The functor C^∞(−):SmoothMfd⟶Alg ℝ^op which sends a smooth manifold (finite dimensional, paracompact, second countable) to (the formal dual of) its ℝ-algebra of smooth functions is a full and faithful functor.
In other words, for two smooth manifolds X,Y there is a natural bijection between the smooth functions X→Y and the ℝ-algebra homomorphisms C^∞(X)←C^∞(Y).

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gelfand-Kolmogorov+theorem
C(−,ℝ):Top cptHaus↪ℝ-Alg^op is a fully faithful functor.
It follows in particular that compact Hausdorff spaces X and Y are homeomorphic precisely if the algebras C(X,ℝ) and C(Y,ℝ) are isomorphic.
