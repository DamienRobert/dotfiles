 HISTORICAL ESSAY ON F_SIGMA LEBESGUE NULL SETS 

We say a real-valued function f is Baire one if f is the
pointwise limit of some sequence of continuous functions.
Examples of Baire one functions are functions with countably
many points of continuity, semi-continuous functions,
derivatives, and functions f:R^2 --> R that are separately
continuous in each variable (but not necessarily functions
from R^n to R for n > 2). A function is Baire two if it is
a pointwise limit of Baire one functions.

Given a function f:R --> R, we let C(f) and D(f) denote the sets
of continuity and discontinuity points, respectively, of f.

THEOREM 1:  If f:R --> R is monotone (or even of
            bounded variation), then D(f) is countable.

THEOREM 1': If E is any countable subset of R, then
            there exists a strictly increasing function
            f:R --> R such that D(f) = E.

THEOREM 2:  If f:R --> R is an arbitrary function, then
            D(f) is an F_sigma subset of R.

THEOREM 2': Given any F_sigma subset E of R, then there
            exists a Baire two function f:R --> R such that
            D(f) = E.

REMARK: Very few, if any, of the references point out that
        f can be chosen to be a Baire two function, but the
        actual constructions are clearly Baire two functions.

THEOREM 3:  If f:R --> R is a Baire one function, then D(f)
            is an F_sigma meager (= first category) subset of R.

REMARK: This implies that, for each Baire one function,
        C(f) is dense in R, c-dense in R, and even co-meager
        in every open interval.

THEOREM 3': Given any F_sigma meager subset E of R, then
            there exists a Baire one function such that
            D(f) = E. In fact, f can be chosen to be
            semi-continuous or to be a bounded derivative.

REMARK: A meager F_sigma set can be c-dense in R, have a
        measure zero complement, or to even have a Haudsorff
        h-measure zero complement for any pre-assigned measure
        function h.

THEOREM 4:  If f:[a,b] --> R is Riemann integrable, then
            D(f) is an F_sigma meager & measure zero subset
            of R.

THEOREM 4': Given any F_sigma meager & measure zero subset E
            of [a,b], then there exists a Riemann integrable
            function f:[a,b] --> R such that D(f) = E.

--------------------------------------------------------------

PROOFS OF 4 & 4':

References omitted because this follows from Theorem 2
and the fact -- whose proof can be found in most any real
analysis text -- that a bounded function f:[a,b] --> R is
Riemann integrable if and only if D(f) has measure zero.

Regarding our more precise (and apparently stronger for one
direction) version, note that any F_sigma measure zero set
is a countable union of closed measure zero sets, and hence
a countable union of nowhere dense sets.

Interestingly, despite the ease in which this more precise
version follows from results in virtually every graduate
level real analysis text, I have not seen this more precise
version explicitly stated outside of a handful of research
papers. Rooij/Schikhof [44] comes the closest that I've seen.

Their Exercise 6.I (p. 42) asks the reader to verify that every
F_sigma measure zero set is meager and their Theorem 7.5 (p. 44)
implies that D(f) is F_sigma. Even Oxtoby [40], which gives
an extensive overview of various measure and category analogs,
doesn't mention that D(f) is meager for a Riemann integrable f,
despite having (1) a proof of the Riemann integrability
continuity condition (pp. 33-34), (2) a proof that any D(f)
set is F_sigma (p. 31), and (3) the observation that any
F_sigma Lebesgue measure set is meager (bottom of p. 51).
What makes this result more interesting is that for a Riemann
integrable function f, D(f) is actually "infinitely smaller
than" some meager-and-measure-zero sets. More precisely, there
exists a set E such that E is meager and E has measure zero
such that E cannot be covered by countably many F_sigma measure
zero sets (the latter being the discontinuity sets of Riemann
integrable functions). Thus, not only is it an understatement
to describe the size of the discontinuity sets of Riemann
integrable functions by saying they have measure zero (because
they are also small in the Baire category sense), but it's even
an understatement to describe their size by saying they are
simultaneously measure zero and meager! For more about the size
classification that discontinuity sets of Riemann integrable
functions belong to, see the following post.
