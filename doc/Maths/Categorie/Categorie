  Lectures on n-Categories and Cohomology, John C. Baez, Michael Shulman
       The goal of these talks was to explain how cohomology and other tools of algebraic topology are seen through the lens of n-category theory. Special topics include nonabelian cohomology, Postnikov towers, the theory of "n-stuff", and n-categories for n = -1 and -2. The talks were very informal, and so are these notes. A lengthy appendix clarifies certain puzzles and ventures into deeper waters such as higher topos theory. For readers who want more details, we include an annotated bibliography.

  Higher Operads, Higher Categories, Tom Leinster
    Higher-dimensional category theory is the study of n-categories, operads, braided monoidal categories, and other such exotic structures. It draws its inspiration from areas as diverse as topology, quantum algebra, mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science. This is the first book on the subject and lays its foundations.
    Many examples are given throughout. There is also an introductory chapter motivating the subject for topologists.

Exemples de catégories
======================

Catégories flêches
------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/comma+category
Si f:C->E, g:D->E sont deux foncteurs, on peut définir la catégorie
f/g où les objets sont des flêches f(x)->g(y)
et les flêches sont des flêches x->x', y->y' faisant commuter le diagramme
f(x) -> g(y)
 |       |
f(x')->g(y')

On a des foncteurs d'oublis évident de f/g vers C et D (f(x)->g(y) \mapsto
x ou y), et une transformation naturelle évidente
f/g - (oubli) -> C - f -> E
           =>
f/g - (oubli) -> D - g -> E

f/g est le pullback de E^I->ExE où I={->} par fxg : CxD->ExE.

Exemples:
- If f and g are both the identity functor of a category C, then (f/g) is the category C^2 of arrows in C.
- If f is the identity functor of C and g is the inclusion 1→C of an object c∈C, then (f/g) is the slice category C/c.
- Likewise if g is the identity and f is the inclusion of c, then (f/g) is the coslice category c/C.

A natural transformation τ:F→G with F,G:C→D may be regarded as a functor T:C→(F/G) with T(c)=(c,c,τ c) and T(f)=(f,f). Conversely, any such functor T such that the two projections from (F/G) back to C are both left inverses for T yields a corresponding natural transformation.

F et G sont adjoints ssi F/Id \iso Id/G au dessus de CxD.

Catégorie topologique
---------------------
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+concrete+category
A topological category is a concrete category with nice features matching the ability to form weak and strong topologies in Top.

Catégorie of elements
---------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+elements

Foncteurs
=========

Propriétés de base
------------------

Si F est fidèle, il reflète les monos.
Si F est pleinement fidèle, il est conservatif.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functor+category

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/conservative+functor

A functor F:C→D is conservative if it is “isomorphism-reflecting”
Si F est conservatif, C a les éqs et F les préserve, alors F est faithful.

Ex: Let C be a category with pullbacks. Given any morphism f:X⟶Y, write
f *:C/Y->C/X for the functor of pullback along f between slice categories (base change). If strong epimorphisms in C are preserved by pullback, then the following are equivalent:
  - f is a strong epimorphism;
  - f* is conservative.

* Creating limits: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/created+limit
Let F:C→D be a functor and J:I→C a diagram, and suppose that the composite F∘J has a limit. We say that F creates this limit if J has a limit, and F both preserves and reflects limits of J.
A monadic functor creates all limits that exist in its codomain, and all colimits that exist in its codomain and are preserved by the corresponding monad (or, equivalently, by the monadic functor itself).

Type de foncteurs
-----------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+functor

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+functor
preserve finite limits and regular epimorphisms

lax/strong monoidal functor: Morphism of monoidal categories

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anafunctor
An anafunctor F:C→D is a generalized functor.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/final+functor
A functor F:C→D is final (often called cofinal), if we can restrict diagrams on D to diagrams on C along F without changing their colimit.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concrete+category
Foncteur fidèle de C dans Set.

Theorem 4.4. A finitely complete category is concretizable, i.e., admits a faithful functor to Set, if and only if it is well-powered with respect to regular subobjects.

Accessible functor
------------------
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/accessible+functor
 κ-accessible functor (for κ a regular cardinal) if C and D are both κ-accessible categories and F preserves κ-filtered colimits

Cf Borceux, Vol 2, Th 5.5.7
F a rank (=accessible) si F preserve des alpha-filtered colimits pour un certain ordinal

F: A accessible -> Set est accessible ssi F est une small-colimite de foncteurs représentables;
F: A->B accessibles est accessible ssi Hom_B(x, F.) est accessible pour tout
x dans B; un tel F satisfait la solution set condition.

Cf aussi https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/accessible+category

Proposition 3.6. (adjoint functors)
Every accessible functor satisfies the solution set condition, and every left or right adjoint between accessible categories is accessible. Therefore, the adjoint functor theorem takes an especially pleasing form for accessible categories: a functor is a left (resp. right) adjoint iff it is accessible and preserves all small colimits (resp. limits).

Solid and topological functor
-----------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/solid+functor
=semi-topological

Let U:A→X be a faithful functor. A U-structured sink is a sink in X of the form (Ua_i →^f_i x). Note that the indexing family i∈I need not be a set, it can be a proper class. A semi-final lift of such a U-structured sink consists of a morphism x →g Ub in X such that
  - Every composite g∘f_i:Ua_i→Ub is in the image of U.
  - g is initial with this property
U is called solid if every U-structured sink has a semi-final lift

Examples
  - Any topological functor is solid. Indeed, a functor U is topological just when it has final lifts for all U-structured sinks, where a final lift is a semi-final lift for which g is an isomorphism.
  - Any monadic functor into SetSet is solid.
  - A fully faithful functor is solid if and only if it has a left adjoint.
  - If U:A→X is faithful and has a left adjoint, and moreover A is cocomplete and well-copowered, then U is solid.
  - For C a cofibrantly generated model category with monic generating cofibrations, the forgetful functor from algebraic fibrant objects to C is solid

U solid => U has a left adjoint, A a les colimites de X (en semi-liftant
une colimite dans X), X cocomplet ou X total => A aussi.

[Preuve: Tholen https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-australian-mathematical-society/article/note-on-total-categories/93A6C31D6B0376AE30237095915138EC
It is shown that, for a semi-topological(=solid) functor T: A → X, the category A is total, that is, the Yoneda embedding of A has a left adjoint, if X is total. In particular, monadic categories over Set (possibly without rank) are total, and full reflective subcategories of total categories are total.
La preuve utilise le fait que T:A->X est semi-topologique si T est la
restriction d'un foncteur topologique B->X où A est réflective dans B.]

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+concrete+category
U:C→D tel que pour toute U-source X->U(S_i) il existe un initial lift T/ U(T)=X.
U est automatiquement faithfull; et U est topologique ssi U^op l'est, donc
il existe aussi un final lift T de X pour tout U-sink U(S_i)->X.
[This is a categorification of the theorem that any complete semilattice is a complete lattice.]

Ex: U:Top->Set est topologique.

Properties
 - If C is topological over D, then so is any full retract of C, as long as the functors involved live in Cat/DCat/D.
 - In particular, a reflective or coreflective subcategory of C is topological, as long as the reflectors or coreflectors become identity morphisms in D.
 - The forgetful functor U:C→D is not only faithful but also (for different reasons) essentially surjective. Thus it is never full (except in the trivial case where U is an equivalence, of course).
 - If D is complete or cocomplete, then so is C.
 - If D is total or cototal, then so is C; see solid functor.
 - If D is mono-complete or epi-cocomplete, then so is C.
 - If D is well-powered or co-well-powered, then so is C.
 - If D has a factorization structure for sinks (E,M), then C has one (E′,M′), where M′ is the collection of morphisms in C lying over M-morphisms in D, and E′ the collection of final sinks in C lying over E-sinks in D. This generalizes the lifting of orthogonal factorization systems along Grothendieck fibrations.
 - If D is concrete, then so is C. More generally, if D has a generator, then C is concrete over D.
 - In particular, if D is Set, then C is a concrete category that is complete, cocomplete, well powered, and well copowered.

Functors:
A functor F:C→C′ between topological concrete categories C/D, C′/D with the same base category D preserves initial lifts iff it is right adjoint. It preserves final lifts iff it is left adjoint.

More generally: If a functor F:C→C′ between topological concrete categories C/D, C′/D′ with different base categories lying over a functor F_0:D→D′. If F is right (left) adjoint, then F_0 is right (left) adjoint and F preserves initial (final) lifts. A partial converse holds: If F_0 is right (left) adjoint to G_0 and F preserves initial (final) lifts, then there is functor G lying over G_0 so that F is right (left) adjoint to G.

Flat functor
------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/flat+functor
=correct notion of left exact if C is not finitely complete.

* Definition 2.1. A functor C→Set is (Set)flat if the opposite of its category of elements, el(C)^{op}, is a filtered category.

Proposition 2.3. When C is small, a functor F:C→Set Set-valued flat if and only if its Yoneda extension [C^op,Set]→Set preserves finite limits.
Corollary 2.4. If F:C→Set is flat, then it preserves all finite limits that exist in C. Conversely, if C has finite limits and FF preserves them, then it is flat.

* Definition 2.5. A functor F:C→E is (representably) flat if for each object e∈E, the opposite comma category (e/F)^op is a filtered category.
Since (e/F) is equivalent to the category of elements of the composite C →^F E→^E(e,−) Set, this is equivalent to saying that E(e,F−):C→Set is Set-valued flat for every e∈E. Hence, this notion of flatness may be called representably flat.
Proposition 2.6. A functor F:C→E between small categories is representably flat if and only if the operation Lan_F:[C^op,Set]→[E^op,Set] of left Kan extension preserves finite limits.

Corollary 2.7. If F:C→E is representably flat, then it preserves all finite limits that exist in C. Conversely, if C has finite limits and FF preserves them, then it is representably flat.

Corollary 2.8. If C has finite limits, then a functor C→Set is representably flat if and only if it is Set-valued flat, if and only if it preserves finite limits. However, if C lacks finite limits, then representable flatness of C→SetC\to Set can be stronger than Set-valued flatness.

* Definition 2.9. Let E be a cocomplete topos (for instance a Grothendieck topos). A functor F:C→E is (internally) flat if the statement “F is Set-valued flat, def. 2.1.” is true in the internal logic of E.
Explicitly, this means that for any finite diagram D:I→C, the family of factorizations through lim(F∘D) of the F-images of all cones over D in C is epimorphic in E.

Example 2.11. If E has enough points, then FF is internally flat precisely if for all stalks x^*:E→Set the composite x^*∘F is Set-valued flat.

Proposition 2.12. When C is small, a functor F:C→E is internally flat if and only if its Yoneda extension [C^op,Set]→E preserves finite limits.

Corollary 2.13. If F:C→E is internally flat, then it preserves all finite limits that exist in C. Conversely, if C has finite limits and FF preserves them, then it is internally flat.

* Definition 2.14. Let E be any site. A functor F:C→E is flat if for any finite diagram D:I→C and any cone T over F∘D in E with vertex uu, the sieve
{h:v→u|Th factors through the F-image of some cone over D}
is a covering sieve of u in E.

This subsumes the other three definitions as follows:
  - If E=Set with its canonical topology, then covering-flatness reduces to Set-valued flatness, def. 2.1.
  - More generally, if E is a cocomplete topos with its canonical topology, then covering-flatness reduces to internal flatness, def. 2.9.
  - On the other hand, if E has a trivial topology, then covering-flatness reduces to representable flatness, def. 2.5.

Proposition 2.15. If C is a small category and E is a small-generated site, then a functor F:C→E is covering-flat if and only if its extension [C^op,Set]→Sh(E) preserves finite limits.

Corollary 2.16. If F:C→E is covering-flat, where E has finite limits and all covering families in E are extremal-epic, then F preserves all finite limits that exist in C. Conversely, if C has finite limits and FF preserves them, then it is covering-flat.

* Category of flat functors

For A a category the full subcategory
FlatFunc(A op,Set)⊂Func(A op,Set)
of the category of presheaves on A (which is the free cocompletion of A) on the flat functors is the free cocompletion under filtered colimits. When regarded in this way, flat functors are also known as ind-objects.

(Diaconescu’s theorem)
There is an equivalence of categories Topos(ℰ,PSh(C))≃FlatFunc(C,ℰ)
PSh(C) is the classifying topos for internally flat functors out of C.
This equivalence takes f:ℰ→PSh(C) to the composite C→PSh(C)→f*ℰ

Kan extension
-------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kan+extension
The Kan extension of a functor F:C→D with respect to a functor C->C', is if
it exists,  a kind of best approximation to the problem of finding a functor C′→D which makes the diagram commute.

Global Kan extensions
si p: C->C', on note p^*: [C',D]->[C,D] le pullback.
Left Kan extension: adjoint à gauche p_!
Right Kan extension: adjoint à gauche p_*

Ex: If C′=* is the terminal category, then
  - the left Kan extension operation forms the colimit of a functor;
  - the right Kan extension operation forms the limit of a functor.

Même si un adjoint n'existe pas globalement, on a une notion d'existence
locale, qui donne le Kan extension pour un foncteur p:C->C' particulier:
Lan_p F:=p_! F: C'->D est muni d'une transformation naturelle universelle F => p^* p_! F.

Construction:
If D admits small colimits, the left Kan extension of a functor exists and is pointwise given by the colimit (Lan_p F)(c′)≃lim_→ ((p/Δ_c′)→C→F D)
où p/Δ_c′est la arrow category p(c)->c', ie (p/Δ_c′)≃elements(C′(p(−),c′)).
(c'est la même construction que l'on fait pour yoneda relatif)

Autrement dit Lan_p est donné par la colimite avec poids:
(Lan_p F)(c′)≔colim C′(p(−),c′)F.
ou encore par le coend:
Lan_p F: c'↦∫^{c∈C} hom(p(c),c')⋅F(c).

Attention: Non-pointwise Kan extensions can exist even when D does not admit very many limits (mais on a vu que si D est cocomplète, l'extension de Kan à gauche est pointwise).

Prop: si on prend p:C->C^hat donné par Yoneda, on note Lan_F=Lan_y F.
- the left Kan extension along F takes representable presheaves C(c,−):C→𝒱 to their image under F: Lan_F C(c,−)≃D(F(c),−) for all c∈C.
- if F is a full and faithful functor then F*(Lan_F H)≃H and in fact the (Lan_F⊣F *)-unit of an adjunction is a natural isomorphism Id≃F*∘Lan_F
whence it follows (by this property of adjoint functors) that Lan_F:[C,𝒱]→[D,𝒱] is itself a full and faithful functor.

Application: si X est un topos et C un site, on a
Top(X,Sh(C)) \subset [Sh(C), X] via f^*
d'où par précomposition avec C->Psh(C) (yoneda) -> Sh(C) (sheafication) un
foncteur Top(X,Sh(C)) -> [C,X].
Ce foncteur est pleinement fidèle et son image essentiel consiste en les
foncteurs f: C->X exacts à gauche qui préservent les covers, ie si U_i->V
est un cover dans C, \coprod f(U_i) -> f(V) est un épi effectif dans X.
En allant dans l'autre sens: left exact functors into toposes have left exact left Kan extension along the Yoneda embedding (Yoneda extension) and that this is the inverse image of a geometric morphism of sheaf toposes if the original functor preserves covers.

end/coend
---------

* https://mathoverflow.net/questions/78471/intuition-for-coends
  https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/01/ends.html

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/end
An end is a special kind of limit over a functor of the form F:C^op×C→D (sometimes called a bifunctor).

If we think of such a functor in the sense of profunctors as encoding a
left and right action on the object ∏_c∈C F(c,c) then the end of the
functor picks out the universal subobject on which the left and right
action coincides. Dually, the coend of F is the universal quotient of 
∐_c∈C F(c,c) that forces the two actions of F on that object to be equal.

A classical example of an end is the V-object of natural transformations between V-enriched functors in enriched category theory. Perhaps the most common way in which ends and coends arise is through homs and tensor products of (generalized) modules, and their close cousins, weighted limits and weighted colimits. These concepts are fundamental in enriched category theory.

In ordinary category theory, an end of F in X is an object e of X equipped with a universal extranatural transformation from e to F:
π_c: ∫_{c:C} F(c,c) → F(c,c)
Universal property: given any extranatural transformation with components
θ_c:x→F(c,c) there exists a unique map f:x→e such that θ_c=π_c f

coend: ι_c:F(c,c)→∫^{c:C} F(c,c)

Note: e->F extranatural si pour c->c', alors e->F(c,c)  ->  F(c,c') = commute
                                              ->F(c',c')->  F(c,c')

$ In enriched category theory
Let V be a symmetric closed monoidal category, and let C be a V-enriched category. Let F:C^op⊗C→V a V-enriched functor; we have a covariant and a contravariant action: F(c,d)⊗C(d,e)→F(c,e); F(d,e)⊗C(c,d)→F(c,e).
In detail, the covariant action is the adjunct of the morphism
(F(c,−):C(d,e)→[F(c,d),F(c,e)])∈Hom V(C(d,e),[F(c,d),F(c,e)])
under the Hom-adjunction
Hom_V(C(d,e),[F(c,d),F(c,e)])≃Hom_V(C(d,e)⊗F(c,d),F(c,e))

A V-extranatural transformation θ:v→•F: we have a commutative diagram
v⊗C(c,d)→F(c,c)⊗C(c,d)→F(c,d)
v⊗C(c,d)→F(d,d)⊗C(c,d)→F(c,d)
End: universal extranatural: π:∫_c:C F(c,c)→•F

If X is any V-enriched category and F:C^op⊗C→X is a V-enriched functor, then the end of F in X is, if it exists, an object ∫_c:C F(c,c) of X that represents the functor ∫_c:C X(−,F(c,c)).

$ As a limit
A limit is an equaliser:
∏_c∈Obj(C) F(c) => ∏_c1,c2∈Obj(C) [C(c1,c2),F(c1)]
so the end is the equaliser
∫_c∈C F(c,c) ⟶∏_c∈Obj(C) F(c,c) => ∏_c1,c2∈Obj(C) [C(c1,c2),F(c1,c2)]

The coend of F is the coequalizer ∐_c1,c2 C(c2,c1)⊗F(c1,c2)⇉∐_c F(c,c)→∫_c F(c,c)
c'est à dire si V=Set: ∐_{c′→c′} F(c,c′)⟶⟶ ∐_{c∈C} F(c,c)

Et pareil pour le end: ∏_{c1→c2} F(c1)≃∏_c1,c2 F(c1)^C(c1,c2),
and we write [C(c1,c2),F(c1)]:=F(c1)^C(c1,c2); ie le end est l'éq
∏_c F(c,c) => ∏_c1→c2 F(c1,c2)

$ End as a weighted limit
∫_c∈C F(c,c)={Hom_C,F}≔=lim^{Hom_C} F with weight Hom_C:C^op×C→V

$ Set-enriched coends as ordinary colimits
Let the enriching category be Set. We describe a special way in this case to express ends/coends that give weighted limits/colimits in terms of ordinary (co)limits over categories of elements.
Consider
    C a Set-enriched category/locally small category tensored over Set;
    D be a small category;
    F:D→C a functor;
    W:D^op→Set another functor;
    elW→D^op the category of elements of W

Proposition 3.1. We have a natural isomorphism in C
∫^{d∈D} W(d)⋅F(d)≃lim_→((elW)^op → D →^F C)
between the coend as indicated and the colimit over the opposite of the category of elements of W

Example 3.3. If W=D(−,e) is a representable functor, then (elW)^op=D/e. This has a terminal object e→e. Therefore lim_→(D/e→D→^F C)≃F(e).
Since this is natural in e, the above proposition asserts a natural isomorphism
F(−)≃∫^k∈D D(k,−)⋅F(k).
This statement is sometimes called the co-Yoneda lemma.

=> Any continuous functor preserves ends, and any cocontinuous functor preserves coends
In particular, for functors F:D^op×D→C, we have the isomorphisms
C(∫^x F(x,x) , c) ≅∫_x C(F(x,x),c); C(c, ∫_x F(x,x)) ≅ ∫^x C(c,F(x,x))

$ Fubini
Ordinary limits commute with each other, if both limits exist separately. The analogous statement does hold for ends and coends. Since there it looks like the commutativity of two integrals, it is called the Fubini theorem for ends:
∫_{(A,B)∈𝒜⊗ℬ} T(A,B,A,B) ≃ ∫_{A∈𝒜} ∫_{B∈ℬ} T(A,B,A,B) ≃ ∫_{B∈𝒜} ∫_{A∈ℬ} T(A,B,A,B) where T:(𝒜⊗ℬ)^op⊗(𝒜⊗ℬ)→𝒱

Exemple: 
- natural transformation: [C,D](F,G)=∫_{c∈C} D(F(c),G(c)).
- Kan extension: LanF:b↦∫_c∈C hom(p(c),b)⋅F(c)
- geometric realization is the left Kan extension of a functor F:C→D along the Yoneda embedding Y:C→[C^op,V]
The “geometric realization” of an object X∈[C^op,V] with respect to FF is then the coend |X|:=∫_c∈C F(c)⋅hom(Y(c),X)≃∫_c∈C F(c)⋅X(c)
- tensor product: If S:C^op→D and T:C→D are functors, their tensor product is the coend S ⊗_C T=∫_c S(c)⊗T(c) where the tensor product on the right hand side refers to some monoidal structure on D.

is, if it exists, the object lim^W F∈C which represents the functor (in c∈C)

In particular, if C=V itself, then we get the direct formula
lim^W F≃[K,V](W,F).

Split, reflexive limits
-----------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/split+coequalizer
A split coequalizer is a fork (ie ef=eg) together with morphisms s:C→B and t:B→A such that es=1_C, se=gt, and ft=1_B. This is equivalent to saying that the morphism (f,e):g→e(f,e) has a section in the arrow category of C.
C'est un coéq absolu (stable par tout foncteur).

Exemple: if e:B→C is a split epimorphism, with a splitting s:C→B, then e is a split coequalizer of B⇉_1^{se} B, the morphism t being the identity. Moreover, e is also the split coequalizer of its kernel pair if it exists.


* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflexive+coequalizer
A reflexive pair is a parallel pair f,g:A⇉B having a common section, i.e. a map s:B→A such that f∘s=g∘s=1_B. A reflexive coequalizer is a coequalizer of a reflexive pair.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/retract
id:A→ section i B→ retraction r A; id=ri

=> r is a split epimorphism and i is a split monomorphism. The entire situation is said to be a splitting of the idempotent $ir$.
Accordingly, a split monomorphism is a morphism that has a retraction; a split epimorphism (=has a section) is a morphism that is a retraction.

Commutativite limites colimites
-------------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/commutativity+of+limits+and+colimits
- Filtered colimits commute with finite limits
- Sifted: colimits commute with finite products
  sifted categories = the diagonal functor C→C×C is a final functor
  https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sifted+category
  Example 3.5. categories with finite products are cosifted, ie les limites
  inductives indexées par C^op commutent avec le produit
- Taking orbits under the action of a finite group commutes with cofiltered limits
- Coproducts commute with connected limits

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/distributivity+of+limits+over+colimits
- distributivity of finite products over arbitrary coproducts
- More generally, finite products distribute over arbitrary colimits in any cartesian closed category, such as Set.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pullback-stable+colimit
- Colimits are (pullback) stable in any locally cartesian closed category, since in that case the pullback functors f^* all have right adjoints.
Conversely, if C is cocomplete with all stable colimits, and the adjoint functor theorem applies to all its slice categories, then it is locally cartesian closed.
- Colimits are also stable any regular infinitary extensive category, so in
  Grothendieck toposes

Injectif/Projectif
------------------

Injective: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/injective+object
An object I in C is J-injective if all diagrams of the form
X->I, j: X->Z admit an extension Z->I.
If J is the class of all monomorphisms, we speak merely of an injective object.
Ones says that a category C has enough injectives if every object admits a monomorphism into an injective object.
Remark 1.7. If C is a locally small category then I is J-injective precisely if the hom-functor Hom C(−,I):C^op→Set takes morphisms in J to epimorphisms in Set.

Dans une catégorie abélienne:
For C an abelian category the class J of monomorphisms is the same as the class of morphisms f:A→B such that 0→A→f B is exact, so I injective <=>
the hom-functor Hom C(−,I):C^op→Set is exact.

Limites et colimites
--------------------

For a functor F:C×D→E, there is a canonical morphism colim_C lim_D F → lim_D colim_C F.

In Set, filtered colimits commute with finite limits. In fact, C is a filtered category if and only if C-colimits commute with finite limits in Set.
More generally, filtered colimits commute with L-finite limits.
By the above remarks, it follows that filtered colimits commute with finite limits in any Grothendieck topos.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/L-finite+category
(<=>)
- The terminal object of [C,Set] is (ω-)compact.
- C-limits commute with filtered colimits in Set.
- C has an initial finitely generated subcategory.
- C admits an initial functor from a finite category.1
- C-limits lie in the saturation of the class of finite limits.

Ind and pro-objects
-------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ind-object
Let Ind(𝒞)⊂PSh(𝒞) be the full subcategory of the presheaf category PSh(𝒞)=[𝒞 op,Set] on those functors/presheaves which are filtered colimits of representables, i.e. those for which X≃colim_d∈D Y(α(d)) for D some filtered category.

Remark 2.2. The functors 𝒞 op→Set belonging to Ind(𝒞) under this definition — those which are filtered colimits of representables — have an equivalent characterization as the flat functors: those which “would preserve all finite colimits if 𝒞\mathcal{C} had them”. In particular, if 𝒞 has finite colimits, then Ind(𝒞) consists exactly of the finitely cocontinuous presheaves.

Proposition 4.1. If 𝒞 is a locally small category then so is Ind(𝒞).

Proposition 4.2. Ind(𝒞) admits small filtered colimits and the defining inclusion Ind(𝒞)↪PSh(𝒞) commutes with these colimits.

Morphisms between ind-objects are represented by natural transformation of the filtered diagrams that represent them, possibly up to restricting these diagrams first along a final functor.

Proposition 4.5. The canonical inclusion y:𝒞↪Ind(𝒞) (factoring the Yoneda embedding) is right exact.

Proposition 4.6. Let 𝒞 have all finite limits or all small limits. Then also Ind(𝒞) has all finite or small limits, respectively, and the canonical functor y:𝒞⟶Ind(𝒞) preserves these, respectively.

Proposition 4.7. If 𝒞 has cokernels, then so does Ind(𝒞)
If 𝒞 has finite colimit coproducts, then Ind(𝒞) has small coproducts.
If 𝒞 has all finite colimits, then Ind(𝒞) has all small colimits.

- Recognition of Ind-objects

Proposition 4.8. A functor F:𝒞 op→Set Set is in Ind(𝒞) (i.e. is a filtered colimit of representables) precisely if the comma category (Y,F) (with Y the Yoneda embedding) is filtered and cofinally small.

Proposition 4.9. If 𝒞 admits finite colimits, then Ind(𝒞) is the full subcategory of the presheaf category PSh(𝒞) consisting of those functors F:𝒞 op→Set such that F is left exact and the comma category (Y,F) (with Y the Yoneda embedding) is cofinally small.

- Functoriality

Ind-cocompletion is functorial – in fact an underlying 2-functor of a lax-idempotent 2-monad (KZ-monad).

Proposition 4.12. Let 𝒞 be a category which has all small filtered colimits. Then the canonical functor 𝒞⟶Ind(𝒞) defines a reflective subcategory, i.e. it is a fully faithful functor with a left adjoint L 𝒞 ⊥⟶⟵L Ind(𝒞)
which takes formal filtered colimits to actual filtered colimits in 𝒞: L:lim⟶ f_α ↦ lim⟶ α

If 𝒞 is a category such that
  - every object of 𝒞 is a filtered colimit of compact objects;
  - 𝒞 has all small filtered colimits
Then 𝒞 is equivalent to Ind(𝒞_cpt)

- Applications
    One important use of categories of ind-objects is in abelian sheaf-theory: for every small abelian category 𝒞 the category ind-𝒞 is a Grothendieck category and hence a good coefficient object for abelian sheaf cohomology.
Cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+category

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pro-object
A pro-object of a category C is a “formal cofiltered limit” of objects of C.
The category of pro-objects in 𝒞 is the opposite category of that of ind-objects in the opposite catgegory of 𝒞.

- Via filtered limits of presheaves

Another, equivalent, definition is to let pro-C be the full subcategory of the opposite functor category/presheaf category [C,Set]^op determined by those functors which are cofiltered limits of representables.
This is reasonable since the copresheaf category [C,Set]^op is the free completion of C, so pro-C is the “free completion of CC under cofiltered limits.”

=> on dit aussi que ce sont les prorepresentable functor

These functors are ‘exactly’ the left exact functors, (at least with a caveat on size)

Alors Nat(h^A,F) ≅ F(A).

Pr: en effet, pour tout élément x de F(A), il existe un unique morphisme

Reformulation: on a un foncteur de la catégorie des foncteurs vers Set;
à un foncteur F on associe A->F(A).
Yoneda montre que ce foncteur est représentable par h^A, ie on a exactment
F(A)=Morphismes dans la catégorie des foncteurs de h^A vers F.

Si C est une catégorie, je note Chat la catégorie des préfaisceaux de C,
y:C->Chat le plongement de Yoneda. Comme Set a les limites et colimites,

De plus presque par définition, Yoneda préserve les limites:
lim C_i existe ssi lim y(C_i) est représentable.
De même: f: A-> B est un mono ssi y(A)->y(B) est un mono.

Yoneda enrichi
--------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/enriched+Yoneda+lemma
Let V be a (locally small) closed symmetric monoidal category, so that V is enriched in itself via its internal hom.

- Weak form: α:hom C(c,−)→F is in natural bijection with the set of elements of F(c), where F:C→V is a V-enriched functor.

Set of elements of F = the set of morphisms I→F(c), obtained by composition:
I →1_c hom C(c,c) →αc F(c)

- Strong form:
Now suppose that V is in addition (small-)complete (has all small limits). Then, given a small V-enriched category C and V-enriched functors F,G:C→V, one may construct the object of V-natural transformations as an enriched end:
V^C(F,G)=∫_c V(F(c),G(c))
(which may in turn be expressed as an ordinary limit in V). This is the hom-object in the enriched functor category.

A strong form of the enriched Yoneda lemma specifies a V-natural isomorphism
V^C(hom C(c,−),F)≅F(c).

This implies the weak form by applying the functor hom(I,−):V→Set

Co-Yoneda lemma
--------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+elements
Given a functor P:C→Set, the category of elements el(P) (or ∫_𝒞 P) is the
corresponding discrete fibration:
- It is the category whose objects are pairs (c,x) where cc is an object in C and x is an element in P(c) and morphisms (c,x)→(c′,x′) are morphisms u:c→c′ such that P(u)(x)=x′.
- It is the pullback along P of the universal Set-bundle: U: Set_* -> Set
  where U is the forgetful functor from pointed sets to sets.
- it is the comma category (*/P)
- its opposite is the comma category (Y/P), where Y is the Yoneda embedding
- It is the (strict) oplax colimit of the composite C→P Set →disc Cat; see Grothendieck construction.

Theorem 3.2. The functor el:Set^C→Cat has a right adjoint (which is maybe a more direct way to see that it is cocontinuous).

Exemples for representable presheaves: ∫_𝒞 Y(C)≃𝒞/C
Since PSh(∫_𝒞 P)≃PSh(𝒞)/P in general for presheaves P:𝒞^op→Set, we get
PSh(𝒞)/Y(C)≃PSh(𝒞/C).

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/co-Yoneda+lemma

The (enriched) Yoneda lemma [𝒞^op,V](𝒞(−,c),F)≃F(c) can be restated as
∫_c′∈𝒞 V(𝒞(c′,c),F(c′))≃F(c).

Under abstract duality an end turns into a coend, so a co-Yoneda lemma ought to be a similarly fundamental expression for F(c) in terms of a coend.

Proposition 2.2. Every presheaf F is a colimit of representables, in that
F(c)≃∫_c′∈C 𝒞(c,c′)⊗F(c′)
hence F(−)≃∫_c′∈𝒞 Y(c′)⊗F(c′)
where Y denotes the Yoneda embedding. In module-language, using the tensor product of functors, this reads F(c)≃𝒞(c,−)⊗_𝒞 F.

Yet another way to state this is as a colimit over the comma category (Y,F), for Y the Yoneda embedding: F≃colim_{(U→F)∈(Y,F)} Y(U).

Note the similarity with the dirac distribution:
For X a topological space, f:X→ℝ a continuous function and δ(−,x 0) denoting the Dirac distribution, then ∫_x∈X δ(x,x_0)f(x)=f(x_0)

MacLane version:
For D a category, K:D→Set, let (*↓K) be the comma category of elements x∈Kd, let Π:(*↓K)→D be the projection (x∈Kd)↦d and let for each a∈D the functor Δa:(*↓K)→D be the diagonal functor sending everything to the constant value a.
The co-Yoneda lemma in the sense of Kan/MacLane is the statement that there is a natural isomorphism of functor categories
[D,Set](K,D(a,−))≅[(*↓K),D](Δ_a,Π).

The Yoneda extension exhibits the presheaf category PSh(C) as the free cocompletion of C.

F˜(A) ≃ colim_{(Y(U)→A)∈(Y,A)} F(U).

F^≔Y∘F˜:[C^op,Set]→[D^op,Set].
This is in fact a left adjoint to the restriction functor F^*:[D^op,Set]→[C^op,Set] which maps H↦H∘F.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad+with+arities
I. If 𝒜 is dense in 𝒞 and if T is a monad with arities 𝒜 on 𝒞, then 𝒞^T has a dense subcategory Θ_T given by the free T-algebras on objects of 𝒜.
(A monad (T,μ,η) on 𝒞 is said to have arities 𝒜 if ν_𝒜∘T,
où ν_𝒜:𝒞 →[𝒜^op,Set] is the nerve functor, sends canonical 𝒜-cocones to colimiting cocones).
This means that the nerve functor ν_Θ_T:𝒞^T→[Θ_T^op,Set] is full and faithfull
II. Let j:𝒜→Θ_T be the restricted free algebra functor. A presheaf P:Θ_T^op→Set is in the essential image of ν_Θ if and only if the restriction along j,
P∘j:A^op→Set is in the essential image of ν_A.

Proof: the adjunction j_!:[𝒜 op,Set]⇄[Θ T op,Set]:j^* given by restriction and left Kan extension. The assumption that T has arities 𝒜 can be reformulated to say that the nerve ν_𝒜:𝒞→[𝒜 op,Set] is a strong monad morphism from T to j^* j_!, i.e. there is a coherent isomorphism ν_𝒜T≅j^*j_!ν 𝒜. Since ν_𝒜 is fully faithful, this means that if we identify 𝒞 with the image of ν_𝒜, then the monad T gets identified with j^* j_!. But the adjunction j_!⊣j^* is also monadic (since j is bijective on objects), so the category of T-algebras gets identified with the full subcategory of j^* j_!-algebras, i.e. presheaves on Θ_T\Theta_T, whose underlying presheaf on 𝒜 is in the image of ν_𝒜. This is exactly the two statements of the nerve theorem.

Let T be a nice monad on a nice category. Then there are a canonically-defined small full subcategory Δ_T such that the induced ‘nerve’ functor Alg(T)→[Δ_T^op,Set] is full and faithful. Its essential image consists of the presheaves on Δ_T preserving certain limits.
The ordinary nerve construction comes from taking T to be the free category monad on the category of directed graphs.

- Ordinary nerves
As usual, Δ denotes a skeletal category of nonempty finite totally ordered sets.
Since ordered sets can be regarded as special categories, and order-preserving maps are then just functors, you can view Δ as a full subcategory of Cat. The inclusion Δ→Cat induces a functor
N: Cat → [Δ^op,Set] C ↦ Hom(−,C), called the nerve functor.
The first excellent property of the nerve functor is that it is full and faithful. (In the jargon, Δ is a dense subcategory of Cat.)
The second excellent property of the nerve functor is that there is an intrinsic description of its essential image. In fact, there are many such descriptions, and you probably know a couple (e.g. via Segal conditions, or unique filling of inner horns). So you could define a category as a simplicial set conforming to one of these descriptions, and a functor as a map between such simplicial sets.

In details: a simplicial set X is the nerve of a category if and only if for each k,n1,…,nk∈ℕ, the colimit
[n1] +_[0] [n2] +[0]⋯+[0] [nk]=[n1+⋯+nk] in Δ is turned by X into a limit in Set. (Here +_[0] means pushout over [0].) In other words, for all k and n_i, the canonical map
X_{n1+⋯+nk}→Xn1 ×_X0 Xn2 ×_X0⋯×_X0 Xnk is an isomorphism. This is one of the well-known Segal-type characterizations of nerves of categories.

Attention: Why Δ? One answer might be that Δ is the free monoidal category on a monoid. But that’s just wrong: Δ, as defined above and in most of the literature, does not include the empty set, whereas this free monoidal category D is a skeleton of the category of finite, possibly empty, totally ordered sets. Had you been shooting for D, you’d have hit it — but presheaves on D are not the same as simplicial sets.

- Generalized nerves
The category ℰ of directed graphs is a presheaf on the small category E=(0=>1)
Now, the free category monad T can be described as follows: for a directed graph X, (T(X))_0 = Hom([0],X), (T(X))_1 = ∑_n∈ℕ Hom([n],X).
Here [n] means the directed graph •→•→⋯→• with n arrows; the free category on it is the ordered set also called [n]. The summation means coproduct.

The category ℰ is ‘nice’ if it is a presheaf category [E^op,Set] monad T=(T,η,μ)is ‘nice’ if
  - For each e∈E, the functor (T(−)) is a coproduct of representables:
    T(X)_e= ∑_i∈I(e) Hom(W_e,i,X)
    (<=> T preserves connected limits <=> ℰ→ℰ/T(1) has a right adjoint)
  - The unit η and multiplication μ are cartesian natural transformations (that is, the naturality squares are not only commutative but pullbacks). 
Write F:[E^op,Set]→Alg(T) for the free T-algebra functor. Then Δ_T is the full subcategory of Alg(T) consisting of the algebras F(W_e,i), for e∈E and i∈I(e).

Examples
- M-sets  Let’s begin with a simple one. Fix a monoid M. The category of sets is certainly ‘nice’, as is the free left M-set monad M×− on Set. If you work it out, you’ll see that Δ_T=M^op, so that a T-simplicial set (presheaf on Δ_T) is a functor M→Set. The limit-preservation condition is vacuous, so we recover the basic observation that the category of left M-sets is the functor category [M,Set].
- Strict n-categories
- Weak n-categories
- Multicategories

- Commentaires:
Consider the following three conditions on a functor U:ℰ→Set:
  - U has a left adjoint
  - U is representable
  - U preserves limits.
Various implications hold in complete generality, but let’s assume for convenience that ℰ satisfies the hypotheses of the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem. (E.g. ℰ might be a presheaf category [E^op,Set] for some small E.) Then the three conditions are equivalent.
Under the same hypotheses on ℰ, the following are equivalent:
  - the induced functor ℰ→Set/U(1) has a left adjoint
  - U is a coproduct of representables
  - U preserves connected limits.

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/profunctor
A profunctor from C to D is a functor of the form H_F:D^op×C→Set.
A basic fact is that for A a cocomplete category, colimit-preserving functors from presheaves on some small category C to A are canonically equivalent to functors from C to A: we have an equivalence of functor categories
Cocont(PSh(C),A)≃Func(C,A).
This may be thought of as a consequence of the co-Yoneda lemma (and hence, of course, of the Yoneda lemma) which says that every presheaf is a colimit over representables, i.e. over objects in the image of the Yoneda embedding Y:C→PSh(C). This immediately implies that a colimit-preserving functor on PSh(C) is already determined by its restriction along Y to C.
Now, profunctors D^op⊗C→V are adjunct to functors C→[D^op,V]≃PSh(D). Hence by the above, profunctors are equivalent to colimit-preserving functors
PSh(C)→PSh(D).
Indeed, there is an equivalence of bicategories between V-Prof and the 2-category of categories and colimit-preserving functors and natural transformations between their presheaf categories.

Générateurs et densité
----------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dense+functor
A functor i:S→C is dense if the corresponding restricted Yoneda embedding C→[S^op, Set] is fully faithful.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/separator

Definition 3.2. A family S=(S_a) of objects of a category 𝒞 is a separating family or a generating family if: for every pair of parallel morphisms f,g: X→Y, if f∘e=g∘e for every e:S_a→X sourced in the family, then f=g.

Assuming that 𝒞 is locally small category, we have equivalently that S is a separator(=generator) if the hom functors Hom(S_a,−):𝒞→Set are jointly faithful; donc sous-catégorie dense => générateur.

Strengthened separators:
If C is locally small and has all small coproducts, then a set (S_a)  is a separating set if and only if, for every X∈C, the canonical morphism ε_X:∐_{a:A,f:S_a→X} S_a⟶X is an epimorphism.
- extremal/strong/regular separator: this is an extremal/strong/regular epi
- In a category with coproducts, every dense generator is regular

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cogenerator
A cogenerator in a category C is an object S such that the functor h_S=C(−,S):C^op→Set is faithful, ie si f,g:X->Y sont deux morphismes tel que la composition avec tout morphisme Y->S est une équalité, alors f=g.
Note: on a la notion de générateurs, et de famille de (co)générateurs [cogénérateurs: pour toute flêche Y->S_i...], cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/separator

Example: In Set, the set of truth values is a cogenerator. More generally, in any well-pointed topos, the subobject classifier is a cogenerator.
Proposition 2.1. Every topos with a small set of generators (e.g., a well-pointed topos, or a Grothendieck topos), and that has products of objects indexed over sets no larger in cardinality than the generating set, admits an injective cogenerator.

* GENERATORS  AND  COLIMIT  CLOSURES MICHAEL A. SHULMAN
  http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/generators.pdf

C cocomplete and finitely complete; then
dense ⇒ colimit-dense ⇒ colimit-generator ⇒ strong generator ⇒ generator
If C is cocomplete, finitely complete, and extremally well-copowered, then any strong generator is a colimit-generator.

Définitions: pour une catégorie C
(i) G is a generator. 
(ii)  The restricted Yoneda embedding A→ [G , Set] is faithful.
(iii) The restricted Yoneda embedding A→ [G op , Set] is faithful.
(iv)  For all X , the map ε_X : ∐_{Q → X} Q → X is epic

(i) G strong generator
(ii) if m is a monic such that every Q → Y with Q ∈ G factors through m , then m
is an isomorphism
(iii) A→ Set^G is conservative.
(iii) A→ [ G^op , Set ]  is conservative.
(iv) ε_X : ∐_{Q → X} Q → X is extremal epic for all X .

G is a colimit-dense generator if every object of A is a colimit of objects of G in some way.

G is a colimit-generator (this is a nonstandard term) if A is the colimit-closure of G , i.e. the only subcategory of A containing G and closed under colimits is A itself 

2-Yoneda lemma
--------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma+for+bicategories
For any bicategory C, any object x∈C, and any pseudofunctor F:C^op→Cat, there is an equivalence of categories
[C^op,Cat](C(−,x),F)≃F(x)
which is pseudonatural in x and F, and which is given by evaluation at 1_x, i.e. α:C(−,x)→F maps to α_x(1_x).

In particular, the Yoneda lemma for bicategories implies that there is a Yoneda embedding for bicategories C→[C^op,Cat] which is 2-fully-faithful, i.e. an equivalence on hom-categories. Therefore, C is equivalent to a sub-bicategory of [C^op,Cat]. Since Cat is a strict 2-category, it follows that C is equivalent to a strict 2-category, which is one form of the coherence theorem for bicategories.

* https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004B

Lemma 4.40.1 (2-Yoneda lemma). Let S→C be fibred in groupoids. Let U∈Ob(C). The functor
[Cat/C](C/U,S)⟶SU given by G↦G(id_U) is an equivalence.

Adjonctions
===========

Définition
----------

Une adjonction est un couple de foncteurs adjoints F et G:
Θ_AB: Hom(FA,B) \iso Hom(A,GB).

En particulier, on a un morphisme η qui a A associe 1_FA ∈ Hom(FA,FA)
-> Hom(A,GFA), donc η_A est une map A -> GFA. Et on Θ_AB(h) =
(Gh)η_A [Pr: A->GFA -(Gh)-> GB]

Donc une manière  de voir ça est que η_A est la flêche universelle de A
vers un objet de la forme GB, ie si f est une flêche de A -> GB, il existe
une unique g:FA->B telle que
A -f-> GB
|   /
v  / Gg
GFA
Autrement dit FA est l'objet initial de la catégorie A/G.

D'où une autre définition possible:
si ε est la counité: ε: FGB-> B, on a
F -Fη-> FGF -ε F-> F = 1_F et
G -ηG-> GFG -G ε-> G = 1_G (inversement, η et ε satisfaisant ces propriétés donnent une adjonction)

En terme de préfaisceaux: si F:C->D, on a un foncteur y_F: D-> Chat
(Chat=préfaisceaux sur C) qui à d associe c->Hom(F(c),d).
y_F est simplement la composition de y: D->Dhat avec le pullback L*:Dhat->Chat.
Si y_F(d) est représentable par un élément G(d) dans C pour tout d, alors G
est automatiquement un adjoint à droite de C (c'est à dire que l'adjonction
est automatiquement naturelle).

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangle+identities
The triangle identities or zigzag identities are identities characterized by the unit and counit of an adjunction, such as a pair of adjoint functors. These identities define, equivalently, the nature of adjunction.

Propriétés
----------

* Monades induite et équivalence de catégorie:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)#Algebras_for_a_monad
An adjunction ( F , G , η , ε ) between two categories C and D (where F : C → D is left adjoint to G : D → C and η and ε are respectively the unit and the counit) always defines a monad ( G F , η , G ε F ).

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fixed+point+of+an+adjunction
Any pair of adjoint functors restricts to an equivalence of categories on subcategories. These subcategories are sometimes known as the center of the adjunction, their objects are sometimes known as the fixed points of the adjunction.
The equivalences of categories that arise from fixed points of adjunctions this way are often known as dualities. Examples include Pontrjagin duality, Gelfand duality, Stone duality, and the Isbell duality between commutative rings and affine schemes.

Note: un point fixe de l'adjonction est tel que l'unité (resp. la counité)
est un isomorphisme.

* Propriétés pour une paire F/G ou L/R d'ajoints:
- L'adjoint G est unique (à 2-iso près)
- G préserve les limites et F préserve les colimites.
- R is faithful precisely if the component of the counit over every object x is an epimorphism LRx→x
- R is full precisely if the component of the counit over every object x is a split monomorphism LRx→x
- L is faithful precisely if the component of the unit over every object x is a monomorphism x↪RLx
- L is full precisely if the component of the unit over every object x is a split epimorphism x→RLx
- R is full and faithful (exhibits a reflective subcategory) precisely if the counit is a natural isomorphism ϵ:L∘R→≃Id D
  En fait, si L∘R≃Id alors ϵ est un iso.
- L is full and faithful (exhibits a coreflective subcategory) precisely if the unit is a natural isomorphism η:Id C→≃R∘L
- The following are equivalent:
    L and R are both full and faithful;
    L is an equivalence;
    R is an equivalence.
- La restriction des sous-catégories où ε et η sont des isos induit une
  équivalence de catégorie.

* Conservatif
http://icms.kaist.ac.kr/mathnet/thesis_file/JKMS-23-1-19-33.pdf
"some remark on conservative functors with left adjoint"

\epsilon_x: LR x->x est un strong épi => R est conservatif et la réciproque
est vraie dans de bonnes catégories, par ex si C a (StrongEpi, Mono)
factorisation, ou si C a les pullbacks et pushouts, ou si C a
pullbacks+equs.

Plus précisément, \epsilon est un strong épi <=> R reflète les strongs épi.
Prop:
(i) \epsilon strong épi
(ii) R conservatif
(iii) \epsilon est extrémal
Alors (i)=>(ii)=>(iii) et (iii)=>(i) si C a (StrEpi, Mono) factorisation,
ou si C a pullbacks+equalisers ou si C a pullbacks et pushouts

Th: Si R est conservatif, alors \epsilon est un familial strong épi si
a) C a pullbacks+pushouts
b) C a non empty finite limits + arbitrary intersection of mono
c) C a les coeqs + arbitrary cointersection of strong epi
d) C a all small limits (et dans ce cas \espsilon est small familial strong)
et dans ce cas R réflète toutes les limites (toutes les small limites pour le cas d)

De plus, cf la section "adjoint triangle theorem for conservative
functors", si RP a un adjoint à gauche, P en a un dès que
(i) epsilon_R est familial strong et C a les coeqs+arbitrary cointersections of strong épis
(ii) epsilon_R est small familial strong et C weakly cowellpowered [=small set of strong subobjects]+ (coeqs + arbitrary cointersections of strong épis OR (StrEpi, Mono) fact + small products)

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mate
Given a 2-category K, adjoint pairs (η,ϵ):f⊣u:b→a and (η′,ϵ′):f′⊣u′:b′→a′, and 1-cells x:a→a′ and y:b→b′, there is a bijection
K(a,b′)(f′x,yf)≅K(b,a′)(xu,u′y)

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Beck-Chevalley+condition
given a commutative square of functors [f*, g*, h*, k*] in which 
f* and h* have left adjoints f_! and h_!,
then the natural isomorphism that makes the square commute k*f*→h*g*
has a mate h_!k*→g*f_! defined as the composite
h_!k*→h_!k*f*f_!≅h_!h*g*f_!→g*f_!.
We say the original square satisfies the Beck–Chevalley condition if this mate is an isomorphism.
More generally, it is clear that for this to make sense, we only need a transformation k*f*→h*g*; it doesn’t need to be an isomorphism. We also use the term Beck–Chevalley condition in this case.

$ 3. In logic / type theory
 D →h C 
k↓    ↓g
 A →f B
In terms of this the Beck-Chevalley condition says that if the above diagram is a pullback, then substitution commutes with existential quantification
∑_k h*ϕ →≃ f* ∑_g ϕ.

Existence
---------
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor+theorem

A functor R: D ⟶ C has a left adjoint L iff
  - R preserves all limits that exist in D
  - for each object c∈C, the limit of the canonical functor out of the comma category of c/R->C existe, cette limite étant L(c)

En particulier, si D a toute les limites (grandes et petites), et que R
préserve les limites, R a un adjoint L. Mais une petite catégorie complète
est un poset, cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor+theorem,
donc en fait il faut supposer des conditions de taille sur D et R en
général.
Par exemples: si R préserve toutes les limites  et
- D is complete and locally small, and G satisfies the solution set condition.
  (= the comma categories (c↓R) all admit small weakly initial families of objects.)
  (General adjoint functor theorem)
  [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/solution+set+condition
  Here is the connection with the adjoint functor theorem: when small products exist in those comma categories, this is equivalent to saying that they all admit weakly initial objects. When small equalizers exist in those comma categories also, this is equivalent to saying that they all admit initial objects, and this is equivalent to R being a right adjoint.]
- D is complete, locally small well-powered, and has a small cogenerating set, and C is locally small.
  (Special adjoint functor theorem)
- D is locally small and cototal, and C is locally small.
Dans les deux premiers cas il suffit que R préserve toutes les small
limites.

Inversement, un foncteur qui préserve toutes les colimites L: C->D a un adjoint à droite si
- C cocomplet, locally small well-copowered with a small generating set, D
  locally small
  [en particulier: C locally presentable]
- C locally small et total, D locally small

Borceux: a functor between accessible categories is a left (resp. right) adjoint iff it is accessible and preserves all small colimits (resp. limits).

Theorem 2.2. Let F:C→D be a functor between locally presentable categories. Then
  - F has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all small colimits (car C est totale).
  - F has a left adjoint if and only if it is an accessible functor and preserves all small limits.

Proposition 3.2. Every sheaf topos is a total category and a cototal category.
Corollary 3.3. Let F:C→D be a functor between sheaf toposes. Then
  - F has a right adjoint precisely if it preserves all small colimits;
  - F has a left adjoint precisely if it preserves all small limits.

Note: en particulier si F: E->Set est un foncteur continu d'un topos de
Grothendieck vers set, alors il a un adjoint à gauche G, et comme 1 est
initial, F=G(1) est représentable!

Lifting
-------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+lifting+theorem
Q: A -> B    U:A->C, V:B->D
   |    |
R: C -> D
Si U et V sont monadiques, et A a les coeq des paires reflectives, alors si
R a un adjoint à gauche L, Q aussi.
Si de plus R=Id, Q est monadique.

Adjoint triangle theorem:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+triangle+theorem
Suppose that U:B→C is a functor which has a left adjoint F:C→B with the property that the diagram
  FUFU ⇉_{ϵFU}^{FUϵ} FU →^ϵ 1_B
is a pointwise coequalizer (i.e. U is of descent type). Suppose that A is a category with coequalizers of reflexive pairs; then a functor R:A→B has a left adjoint if and only if the composite UR does.

Remark 2.2. The hypotheses on U are satisfied whenever it is monadic.
Remark 2.3. In fact, it suffices to assume that each counit ϵ:FUb→b is a regular epimorphism, rather than it is the coequalizer of a specific given pair of maps.

Idempotent adjunction
---------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/idempotent+adjunction

Donne des conditions équivalentes au fait que the monad induced by the
adjunction is idempotent; en particulier F et G se factorise en F_1, F_2,
G_1, G_2: C->E->D where F_2 and G_1 are fully faithful, i.e. F_1⊣G_1 is a reflection and F_2⊢G_2 is a coreflection; autrement dit E est une sous-catégorie réflective de E, et coréflective de D.

Definition 1.1. Let F:C⇄D:G be an adjunction with unit η and counit ε. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
  - Fη is a natural isomorphism.
  - εF is a natural isomorphism.
  - GεF is a natural isomorphism — i.e. the monad induced by the adjunction is idempotent.
  - GFη=ηGF
  - GFηG=ηGFG
  - Gε is a natural isomorphism.
  - ηG is a natural isomorphism.
  - FηG is a natural isomorphism — i.e. the comonad induced by the adjunction is idempotent.
  - FGε=εFG
  - FGεF=εFGF

For an idempotent adjunction as in def. 1.1, the functors F and G restrict to an equivalence of categories between the full images of F and of G (which are, respectively, a coreflective subcategory of D and a reflective subcategory of C, both equivalent to the E).

If an idempotent adjunction is monadic, then (up to equivalence) it consists of the inclusion and reflection of a reflective subcategory (i.e. the algebras for an idempotent monad).

Note:
- si G (resp. F) est pleinement fidèle, alors F-|G est idempotent et on a E=D (resp E=C) [avec les notation plus haut], ie D reflective dans C (resp. C coreflective dans C)
- si F-|G est idempotent en particulier Coalg(FG) and Alg(GF) are equivalent (à la catégorie E), cf https://mathoverflow.net/questions/36766/adjunctions-algebras-of-the-induced-monad-vs-coalgebras-of-the-induced-comonad
  qui rajoute:
  One interesting situation where there is an equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category of algebras is where a monad has a right adjoint. One may then exhibit a canonical comonad structure on this right adjoint, such that its category of coalgebras is canonically equivalent to the category of algebras of the original monad. This comes up in topos theory, for example, where for a category of presheaves Set^C^op, the evident forgetful functor Set^C^op→Set^Ob(C) is both monadic and comonadic.

Adjoint triple
--------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+triple
(F⊣G⊣H):C⟶D

An adjoint triple (F⊣G⊣H) is equivalently an adjoint pair in the 2-category whose morphisms are adjoint pairs in the original 2-category, hence an adjunction of adjunctions (F⊣G)⊣(G⊣H).

Every adjoint triple (F⊣G⊣H):C→D
gives rise to an adjoint pair (GF⊣GH):C→C
consisting of a monad GF left adjoint to the comonad GH on C;
as well as an adjoint pair (FG⊣HG):D→D.

Proposition 2.3. For an adjoint triple F⊣G⊣H we have that F is fully faithful precisely if H is fully faithful.

=> https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality
In (Lawvere 94) an adjoint cylinder is defined to be an adjoint triple such that the outer two adjoints are full and faithful functors. This means equivalently that the induced adjoint pair on the codomain of these inclusions consists of an idempotent monad and comonad (adjoint monads)

Exemple: For instance, if G:D→C is a topological concrete category, then it has both a left and right adjoint which are fully faithful.

Proposition 2.6. For an adjoint triple F⊣G⊣H, the adjunction F⊣G is an idempotent adjunction if and only if the adjunction G⊣H is so.

Exemple:
Given any ring homomorphism f^∘:R→SS (in commutative case dual to an affine morphism f:SpecS→SpecR of affine schemes), there is an adjoint triple f^!⊣f_*⊣f^* where f^*: RMod→ SMod is an extension of scalars, f_*: SMod→ RMod the restriction of scalars and f^!:M↦Hom_R(_R S, _R M) its right adjoint. This triple is affine in the above sense.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+monad
Given a monad T=(T,μ T,η T) which has a right adjoint G, automatically G is a part of a comonad G=(G,δ G,ϵ G) where δ_G and ϵ_G are in some sense dual to μ_T and η_T. Thus there is a bijective correspondence between monads having a right adjoint and comonads having a left adjoint 

Pr:
- If T⊣G then T^k⊣G^k
- Given two adjunctions S⊣T and S′⊣T′ where S,S′:B→A, then there is a bijection between the natural transformations ϕ:S′⇒S and natural transformations ψ:T⇒T qui font commuter le diagramme issu des adjonctions.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+quadruple
Every adjoint quadruple (f_!⊣f^*⊣f_*⊣f^!):C←f !→f *←f *→f !D
induces an adjoint triple on C (f^*f_!⊣f^*f_*⊣f^!f_*):C→C
(hence a monad left adjoint to a comonad left adjoint to a monad) and an adjoint triple (f_!f^*⊣f_*f^*⊣f_*f^!):D→D on D.
Since moreover every adjoint triple (F⊣G⊣H) induces an adjoint pair (GF⊣GH) and an adjoint pair (FG⊣HG) the adjoint quadruple above induces four adjoint pairs.

Exemples
--------

* Topological dualities

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality
The Pontryagin duality theorem:
There is a canonical isomorphism G ≅ G^^  between any locally compact abelian group G and its double dual.
=> Fourier transform pour la mesure de Haar

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaka%E2%80%93Krein_duality
Tannaka's theorem provides a way to reconstruct the compact group G from its category of representations Π(G):
let F: Π(G) → Vect_C be the forgetful functor from finite-dimensional complex representations of G to complex finite-dimensional vector spaces, and let
T(G) the group of all tensor-preserving, self-conjugate natural transformations of F. Then the map G → T(G), x -> multiplication by x on each representation, is an isomorphism.

Krein's theorem answers the following question: which categories can arise as a dual object to a compact group?

- Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra A is isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.

- Gelfand duality: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gelfand+duality
the functor C(−,C) from  topological spaces to the  dual  category of (involutive) C-algebras  which is left adjoint to the Gelfand spectrum Hom(−, C). This adjunction restricts to an equivalence of categories between compact Hausdorff spaces and the  dual category of unital commutative C∗-algebras, et induit une équivalence entre les espaces Hausdorff loc. compact [que l'on peut identifier via le point à l'infini aux espaces de Hausdorff pointés] et les C*-algèbres commutatives non unitales. [En effet, l'unitation donne une équivalence de catégorie entre C*Alg sans unités et C* Alg/C, et le dual de C* Alg/C est */Top_copt.]

* Isbell duality

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Isbell+duality

- Definition

Let 𝒱 be a good enriching category (a cosmos, i.e. a complete and cocomplete closed symmetric monoidal category).
Let 𝒞 be a small 𝒱-enriched category.
Write [𝒞^op,𝒱] and [𝒞,𝒱] for the enriched functor categories.

Proposition 2.1. There is a V-adjunction
(𝒪⊣Spec):[C,𝒱]^op →Spec ←𝒪 [C^op,𝒱]
where 𝒪(X):c↦[C^op,𝒱](X,𝒱(−,c)) and Spec(A):c↦[C,𝒱]^op(𝒱(c,−),A).

All representables are Isbell self-dual: O Spec(V(c,-))=V(c,-)
                                         Spec O(V(-,c))=V(-,c)

Choose any class L of limits in CC and write [C,𝒱]_×⊂[C,𝒱] for the full subcategory consisting of those functors preserving these limits.
Proposition 3.1. The (𝒪⊣Spec)-adjunction does descend to this inclusion, in that we have an adjunction
(𝒪⊣Spec):[C,𝒱]_×^op →Spec←𝒪 [C^op,𝒱]
Proof: the hom functor preserve all limits, so in particular L limits.

- Dualities for function T-Algebras on presheaves

Let C:=T be the syntactic category of a 𝒱-enriched Lawvere theory, that is a 𝒱-category with finite products such that all objects are generated under products from a single object 1.

Then write TAlg:=[C,𝒱]_× for category of product-preserving functors: the category of T-algebras. This comes with the canonical forgetful functor
U_T:TAlg→𝒱:A↦A(1)
Write F_T:T^op↪TAlg for the Yoneda embedding.

Definition 4.1. Call 𝔸_T:=Spec(F_T(1))∈[C^op,𝒱] the T-line object.

Observation 4.2. For all X∈[C^op,𝒱] we have
𝒪(X)≃[C^op,𝒱](X,Spec(F_T(−))). In particular U_T(𝒪(X))≃[C^op,𝒱](X,𝔸_T).

Plus généralement, si T ⊂ C ⊂ TAlg^op, then the original construction of 𝒪⊣Spec no longer makes sense, but that in terms of the line object still does

Proposition 4.3. Set Spec A: B ↦ TAlg(A,B) and 𝒪(X):k↦[C^op,𝒱](X,Spec(F T(k))).
Then we still have an adjunction (𝒪⊣Spec): TAlg_op →Spec←𝒪 [C^op,𝒱].

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Isbell+envelope

Definition 1.1. Let 𝒯 be an essentially small category. Then the Isbell envelope of 𝒯, written E(𝒯), is defined as follows. An object is a triple X=(P,F,c) where
  - P is a contravariant functor 𝒯→Set (a presheaf),
  - F is a covariant functor 𝒯→Set (a copresheaf),
  - c:P×F→𝒯(−,−) is a natural transformation of bifunctors 𝒯^op×𝒯→Set.

Proposition 1.2. There is a (“double/twosided Yoneda”) embedding of 𝒯 as a full subcategory of E(𝒯) via T↦(𝒯(−,T),𝒯(T,−),∘)

Identifying 𝒯 with its image, there are natural isomorphisms
𝒯^g(T,X)≅P_X(T), 𝒯^g(X,T)≅F_X(T)

$ 2. Profunctors
The Isbell envelope of a category can be viewed as a category of profunctors. In short, the Isbell envelope of 𝒯 consists of the lax factorisations of Hom through 1.
En effet, un profoncteur A->B est un foncteur AxB^op->Set, un foncteur covariant F:A->Set peut se voir comme un profoncteur A->1, et un foncteur contravariant B->Set comme un profoncteur G:1->B. La composition nous donne le profoncteur FxG:AxB^op->Set.
An object in the Isbell envelope of 𝒯 produces a profunctor 𝒯→𝒯 which factors through 1. There is an obvious profunctor 𝒯→𝒯 given by the Hom-bifunctor.
This is the identity for profunctor composition.
Thus an object in the Isbell envelope of 𝒯 corresponds to an object in the subcategory of the slice category of profunctors over Hom of those objects which factor through 1.
In other words, a lax factorisation of Hom through 1.
This characterization relates directly to a definition of Cauchy
completion: the Cauchy completion as a subcategory of the Isbell envelope, that factorizes through both the free completion and free cocompletion.

$ 5. Isbell Duality

Definition 5.1. An object X of E(𝒯)is said to be P-saturated if the obvious natural transformations P_X(T)→NatTrans(F_X,𝒯(T,−)) 
are isomorphisms.
It is said to be F-saturated if the obvious natural transformations
F_X(T)→NatTrans(P_X,𝒯(−,T)) are isomorphisms.
It is said to satisfy Isbell duality if it is both P and F-saturated. 

Theorem 5.6. Let 𝒯 be an essentially small category admitting a constant separator. Then for an object X of E(𝒯), the following hold:
  - If X is P-saturated then it is P-concrete,

### Codensity monad

* http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/28/13/28-13abs.html

Codensity and the ultrafilter monad, Tom Leinster
The codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite sets) into (sets) is the ultrafilter monad; the algebra is the category of compact Hausdorff spaces.
The codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is double dualization.
The codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite families of sets) into
(families of sets) is the ultraproduct monad.

- Density:
si F: A->B (A small, B cocomplete), on a une adjonction
Hom(F,-): B -> [A^op, Set] : \tens_F   où \tens_F -| Hom(F,-)
qui induit une comonade sur B: la comonade densité.
F dense <=> the right adjoint Hom(F,-): B->[A^op, Set] is full and faithfull
<=> la comonade densité est triviale (ie the counit is an isomorphism).

Exemples:
- F: \Delta -> Top, [n]->\Delta^n le n-simplexe
  Then Hom(F,−) sends a topological space to its singular simplicial set, and −⊗F sends a simplicial set to its geometric realization.
- Let X be a topological space, with poset O(X) of open subsets. Define
  F:O(X)→Top/X by F(W) = (W↪X). This induces an adjunction between
  presheaves on X and spaces over X, and, like any adjunction, it restricts
  canonically to an equivalence between full subcategories. Here, these are
  the categories of sheaves on X and  ́etale bundles over X. The induced
  monad on the category of presheaves is sheafification

- Codensity:
G: B->A, B essentially small et A complète.
On a une adjonction:
Hom(-,G): A -> [B^op, Set] : Hom(-,G), qui induit une monade T^G sur A: la
codensity monad.
G codense := Hom(-,G): A->[B^op, Set] is full and faithfull <=> T^G=Id

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/codensity+monad
The codensity monad of a functor G can be thought of as the monad induced by G and its left adjoint, even when no such adjoint exists:
The codensity monad 𝕋^G is a generalization of this monad to functors G:ℬ→𝒜 merely admitting a right Kan extension Ran_G G of G along itself, with both monads coinciding in case G:ℬ→𝒜 is a right adjoint.

* https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/09/where_do_monads_come_from.html
A functor G:B→A may or may not have a codensity monad. If it does, it’s a monad on A, and I’ll call it T^G. In the event that G has a left adjoint, F, the codensity monad does exist, and it’s simply GF.

1. The slickest definition: the codensity monad of G is the right Kan extension of G along itself. (This may or may not exist.) The monad structure comes from the universal property of Kan extensions.
2. Slightly more explicitly, the codensity monad T^G can be defined as an end: for A∈A: T^G(A)=∫_B [A(A,GB),GB].
Here [A(A,GB),GB] is a power in A: that is, it’s the product of lots of copies of the object GB, one for each element of the set A(A,GB). The end might or might not exist.
3. If you’re not comfortable with ends, maybe you’ll prefer the same formula expressed as a limit. Let A∈A. Let A/G be the comma category whose objects are maps f:A→GB (or more exactly, pairs (B,f) where B∈B and f∈A(A,GB)). There’s a functor A/G→A sending this object to GB, and T^G(A) is defined to be its limit (if it exists).
4. Here’s a fourth and final way to say it. For this, let’s assume that B is small and A has small limits. Then, à la Kan, the functor G induces an adjunction
Hom(−,G): A →⟵ [B,Set]^op : Hom(−,G)
where I’m calling both functors Hom(−,G), though they’re not the same. The left adjoint Hom(−,G):A→[B,Set]^op is defined by (Hom(A,G))(B)=A(A,GB). I’ll skip the description of the right adjoint — see the paper if you want to know. Of course, the right adjoint is determined by the fact that it’s a right adjoint: explicitly, Hom_A(A,Hom(Y,G))≅Hom_[B,Set](Y,Hom(A,G))
whenever A∈A and Y∈[B,Set]. Anyway, being an adjunction, it induces a monad, and this is the codensity monad of G.

Theorem: given any monad S on A, there’s a natural one-to-one correspondence between:
  - maps of monads S→T^G, and
  - functors B→Alg(S) over A.
So the process of constructing codensity monads is adjoint to the process of constructing the category of algebras for a monad.

Reformulation: (CAT/A)_mndc ⊆ (CAT/A)_CM (monadic functors inside those that have a codensity monad).
The theorem now is that it’s a reflective subcategory. That is, the inclusion functor (CAT/A)_mndc↪(CAT/A)_CM has a left adjoint. The adjoint takes a functor G:B→A and turns it into the forgetful functor Alg(T^G)→A.

In other words, the canonical way to force a functor to be monadic is to first take its codensity monad, then form the corresponding monadic functor.

Exemples:
- the codensity monad of the functor 1→A that picks out the single object A is the endomorphism monad End(A); it sends an object X of A to the power [A(X,A),A].
An SS-algebra structure on A amounts to a monad map S→End(A).
- the codensity monad of G:Field↪Ring is T^G(A)=∏_p∈Spec(A) Frac(A/p)
  On the geometric side, Spec(T^G(A)) is the Stone–ˇCech compactification of the discrete space Spec(A).

- Plus de détails dans le papier:
  T^G est le terminal object de la catégorie K(G)={S: A->A tel que SG=>G},
  par définition comme une right Kan extension de G le long de lui-même.

  The category K(G) is monoidal under composition.  Being the terminal object of amonoidal category, (TG,κ_G) has a unique monoid structure.  This gives T^G the structure of a monad, the codensity monad of G.

  5.2 Lemma: si G:B->A est une inclusion, S une monade sur A qui se
  restreint à l'identité sur B, a:S->T^G une transformation naturelle. (<=>)
  - a est une map de monoïdes dans K(G)
  - a:S->T^G est une map de monades
  - a o \eta^S=\eta^G. [autrement dit pour être une map de monades, il
    suffit de respecter l'unité, ça respectera automatiquement la
    multiplication!]

  Corollaire: T^G est la monade terminale sur A qui se restreint à
  l'identité sur B.

Definition  Let X be a set. An ultrafilter on X is a set Ω of subsets such that whenever X is expressed as a disjoint union of three subsets, exactly one belongs to Ω. Equivalently: whenever X is expressed as a disjoint union of a finite number of subsets, exactly one belongs to Ω.

Theorem  The codensity monad of the inclusion FinSet↪Set is isomorphic to the ultrafilter monad.

Theorem  Let B be a full subcategory of FinSet containing at least one set with at least 3 elements. Then the codensity monad of the inclusion B↪Set is isomorphic to the ultrafilter monad.

Theorem  Let B be a finite set with at least three elements. Then for any set X, the set of End(B)-equivariant maps [X,B]→B is canonically isomorphic to the set of ultrafilters on X.

1.7. Theorem.[B ̈orger] The ultrafilter endofunctor U is terminal among all endofunctors of Set that preserve finite coproducts.

1.8. Corollary.[B ̈orger] The ultrafilter endofunctor U has a unique monad structure. With this structure, it is terminal among all finite-coproduct-preserving monads on Set.

There is also a topological description of the ultrafilter monad.
As shown by Manes [33], it is the monad induced by the forgetful functor
CptHff→Setand its left adjoint. In particular, the Stone–ˇCech
compactification of a discrete space is the set of ultrafilters on it

Theorem  The algebras for the ultrafilter monad are the compact Hausdorff spaces.

Theorem  The codensity monad of FDVect↪Vect is the double dualization monad.
Theorem  The algebras for the codensity monad of FDVect↪Vect are the linearly compact vector spaces.

A linearly compact vector space over a field k is a topological vector space over k such that:
  - the topology is linear: the open affine subspaces form a basis for the topology
  - any family of closed affine subspaces with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection
  - the topology is Hausdorff.
Note: a finite-dimensional vector space can be made into a linearly compact vector space in one and only one way: by giving it the discrete topology. This is like the fact that a finite set can be made into a compact Hausdorff space in one and only one way — again, by giving it the discrete topology.

In summary, we have the following table of analogues:
sets                        vector spaces
finite sets                 finite-dimensional vector spaces
ultrafilters                elements of the double dual
compact Hausdorff spaces    linearly compact vector spaces

(−)∗:Vect^op→Vect is monadic so the algebra for the ** monad is Vect^op. 
- Par la discussion plus haut, Vect^op=linearly compact vector spaces.
- Vect is the Ind-completion (or Ind-cocompletion) of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and therefore Vect^op as the Pro-completion of the opposite category, which is again Vect_fd.
[Dans les commentaires: This extends even further to a duality between coalgebras and pseudocompact algebras (inverse limits of finite dimensional algebras).]

Note: the category of algebras for the double powerset monad on Set is Set^op. This is illuminated by the fact that Set^op is equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.

- https://mathoverflow.net/questions/11261/is-the-ultraproduct-concept-fundamentally-category-theoretic/13455
Let Fam(E) be the category in which an object is a set X together with a family (Sx)x∈X of objects Sx of E.
The ultraproduct construction gives a functor Fam(E)→Fam(E):(∏_U S)_{ultrafilters U on X}. In fact, it gives not just a functor but a monad on Fam(E), the ultraproduct monad for E.
Theorem: The codensity monad of the inclusion functor FinFam(E)↪Fam(E) is the ultraproduct monad for E.

Plus de détails dans le papier:
Ultraproducts can also be understood sheaf-theoretically (as in 2.6.2 of [38]).  A family (Sx)x∈X of sets amounts to a sheaf S on the discrete space X, with stalks Sx. The unit map η_X:X→U(X) embeds the discrete space X into its Stone–ˇCech compactification, and pushing forward gives a sheaf (η_X)_∗ S onU(X). The stalk of this sheaf over U is exactly the ultraproduct ∏_U S.

8.7 Corollary. The category of algebras for the codensity monad of FinFam(Set)↪Fam(Set) is  equivalent  to CHSheaf,  the  category  of  sheaves  on  compact  Hausdorff spaces.

Localisation
============

## Définition

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/localization

A localization of C by W (or “at W”) is a category C[W^−1] and a functor Q:C→C[W^−1] such that
- for all w∈W, Q(w) is an isomorphism;
- for any category A and any functor F:C→A such that F(w) is an isomorphism for all w∈W, there exists a functor F_W:C[W^−1]→A and a natural isomorphism F≃F_W∘Q
- the map between functor categories (−)∘Q:Funct(C[W^−1],A)→Funct(C,A) is full and faithful for every category A.

A weak equivalence W c'est quand W est une sous-catégorie de C, qui
contient les iso, et satisfait la 2-out-of-3: si 2 de {g,f,gof} est dans W,
le troisième aussi.
(Souvent on considère les localisations en de tels W)

## Calculus of fractions

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/calculus+of+fractions
- W is a wide subcategory of C (that is, W contains all identities and is closed under composition).
- si w: x->z est dans W, et f: y->z, on peut tirer en arrière pour avoir
  w': x'->y dans W, f':x'->x qui fait commuter le diagramme (right Ore
  condition)
  [ie v^{-1} o f = f' o v'^{-1}]
- si w∈W coéqualise f,g, alors il existe w'∈W qui équalise f,g.
  (right canceability) [ie si w f=w g alors f w'=g w']

=> il suffit d'inverser les w∈W à droite: f v^{-1} est la classe
d'équivalence a <- v - a' - f -> b; et f v^{-1} = g w^{-1} quand il existe
s, t tels que vos = tow dans W et f s^{-1} v^{-1}=g t^{-1} w^{-1}
(on peut supposer que W est saturé donc que s, t sont dans W).
Pour composer en utilise la condition de Ore: f v^{-1} g w^{-1}=f g' v'^{-1} w^{-1}.
I.E. on utilise des spans plutôt que des zig-zags pour construire la
localisation.

Prop: the localization functor Q:C→C[W^−1] is left exact, and therefore preserves all finite limits existing in C.

Note: on peut supposer W saturé par la 2-out-of-3:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/two-out-of-three
ou même la 2-out-of-6:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/two-out-of-six+property
Note that the 2-out-of-3 property includes closure under composition, and the 2-out-of-6 property together with containment of all identities implies containment of all isomorphisms.
In the presence of either sort of calculus of fractions, the 2-out-of-6 property is equivalent to saturation of W, i.e. that any morphism in C which becomes an isomorphism in C[W^−1] is already in W.

Catégorie reflective
--------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+subcategory
Given any pair of adjoint functors (Q^*⊣Q_*):B⟶A the following are equivalent:
  - The right adjoint Q_* is fully faithful. (In this case B is equivalent to its essential image in A under Q_*, a full reflective subcategory of A.)
  - The counit ε:Q^*Q_*→1_B of the adjunction is a natural isomorphism of functors.
  - The monad (Q_*Q^*,Q_*εQ^*,η) associated with the adjunction is idempotent, the right adjoint Q_* is conservative, and the left adjoint Q^* is essentially surjective on objects.
  - If S is the set of morphisms s in A such that Q^*(s) is an isomorphism in B, then Q^*:A→B realizes B as the (nonstrict) localization of A with respect to S

Any reflective subcategory is recovered as the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras over its associated idempotent monad.
A reflective subcategory is always closed under limits which exist in the ambient category (because the full inclusion is monadic, as noted above), and inherits colimits from the larger category by application of the reflector.
Donc en particulier, si A est complète (cocomplète) alors B aussi.

If the reflector (which as a left adjoint always preserves all colimits) in addition preserves finite limits, then the embedding is called exact. If the categories are toposes then such embeddings are called geometric embeddings.
In particular, every sheaf topos is an exact reflective subcategory of a category of presheaves Sh(C)↪←sheafify PSh(C). The reflector in that case is the sheafification functor.

Theorem 3.1. If X is a reflective subcategory of a cartesian closed category, then it is an exponential ideal if and only if its reflector D→C preserves finite product. [cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exponential+ideal]

Theorem 4.5. A subcategory of a category of presheaves [A^{op}, Set] which is both reflective and coreflective is itself a category of presheaves [B^{op}, Set], and the inclusion is induced by a functor A→B.

[Plus généralement, les auteurs de http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/10/16/10-16abs.html, Simultaneously Reflective And Coreflective Subcategories of Presheaves, Robert El Bashir and Jiri Velebil 
prouvent le résultat dans une catégorie V-enrichie, V symmetric monoidal
closed complete and cocomplete. 

Exemple: V=Ab => toute sous-catégorie pleine de Ab=[Z^op,Ab] qui est
réflexive et coréflexive et de la forme [R^op, Ab], où R est une
Ab-catégorie avec un objet, ie un anneau.

De plus, si un foncteur P:A->B induit par restriction un morphisme
pleinement fidèle y_P: [B^op,V]->[A^op,V]; P est dit connected.

Le foncteur restriction y_P a toujours un adjoint à gauche et à droite
(left/right Kan extension), et P est connecté si la counité de l'extension
de Kan a gauche est un iso <=> P^op est connected <=> [B,V]->[A,V] est
fully faithfull <=> [B,X]->[A,X] est fully faithfull pour tout X <=> P est
absolument dense, ie est dense et les objets de B que l'on peut construire
comme des colimites le long de P sont des colimites absolues.

Note: P est dense si a left Kan extension Lan_P P of P along itself exists and is isomorphic to the identity functor 1_B:B→B

Ex: si f: R->S morphisme d'anneau, f est un épi <=> [R,X] -> [S,X] est
fully faithfull pour toute Ab-catégorie X.
Ex: si V=Set, P est connexe si f//P est connexe pour toute flêche f:b'->b.
Note: si P:A->B est connected, on factorise P=GoF F:A->C, G:C->B où F est
surjectif sur les objets et G fully faithfull; alors F est connected et C
et B sont Morita equivalent, ie ont la même catégorie de préfaisceaux.

Corollaire du théorème:
- Any full reflective and coreflective subcategory of V is equivalent to the category of the form [ A^op , V ] ,where A has one object, that is, it corresponds to a monoid in V.
- R ring => Full reflective and coreflective subcategories of [ R^op , Ab ] are of the form [ S^op , V ] for a one-object Ab -category S , that is, a ring S with a unit. Moreover, the inclusion [ S^op , V ] −→ [ R^op , V ] is induced by an epimorphism of rings f : R → S
]

## Reflective localization

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+localization
A special class of localizations are reflective localizations, those where
the functor C→L_W C has a full and faithful right adjoint. In such a case
this adjoint exhibits L_W C as a reflective subcategory of C.
One shows that L_W C is – up to equivalence of categories – the full subcategory on the W-local objects, and this property precisely characterizes such reflective localizations (ie si la catégorie des objets W-local est réflective, alors c'est L_W C).
Réciproquement, une sous-catégorie réflective C' de C est L_W C où W est la
classe des morphismes envoyés sur des isos par le réflecteur L.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/local+object
c is W-local si y(c) envoie les flêches w:a->b de W sur des isos
Hom(b,c)->Hom(a,c). Un morphisme est W-local ssi y(c)(f) est un iso pour
tout objet c W-local.

Cas d'un topos: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+embedding
Une réflexion exacte est un geometric embedding, elle vient d'une topologie
de Lawvere-Tierney et peut se voir comme une faisceautification.

Let f:F↪E be a geometric embedding and let W⊂Mor(E) be the class of morphisms sent by f^* to isomorphisms in F.
Theorem. We have:
  F is equivalent to the localization E[W^-1]
  F is equivalent to the full subcategory of E on W-local objects.
[De plus W satisfait la 2 out of 3 et W is a left multiplicative system.]

Reflective factorisation system
-------------------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+factorization+system
A reflective factorization system is an orthogonal factorization system (E,M) that is determined by the reflective subcategory M/1.

Let C be a category with a terminal object 1. If (E,M) is an (orthogonal) factorization system on C, then the full subcategory M/1⊆C (consisting of those objects X for which X→1 is in M) is reflective. The reflection of Y∈C is obtained by the (E,M)-factorization Y →e ℓY →m 1.
In fact, in this we do not need (E,M) to be a factorization system; only a prefactorization system with the property that any morphism with terminal codomain admits an (E,M)-factorization. For the nonce, let us call such a prefactorization system favorable.
Conversely, suppose that A↪C is a reflective subcategory, and define E to be the class of morphisms inverted by the reflector ℓ:C→A, and define M=E^⊥. Then (E,M) is a favorable prefactorization system. In this way we obtain an adjunction
Φ:reflective subcategories⇄favorable prefactorization systems:Ψ.
The unit of this adjunction is easily seen to be an isomorphism. That is, given a reflective subcategory A, if we construct (E,M) from it as above, then A≃M/1. Therefore, the adjunction allows us to identify reflective subcategories with certain favorable prefactorization systems.
The prefactorization systems arising in this way — equivalently, those for which (E,M)=ΦΨ(E,M) — are called the reflective prefactorization systems. A reflective factorization system is a reflective prefactorization system which happens to be a factorization system.
More generally, for any favorable factorization system (E,M), we have a reflective prefactorization system ΦΨ(E,M), called the reflective interior of (E,M)

Theorem 3.1. Let (E′,M′) be the reflective interior of (E,M). Then:
  - f∈E′ precisely when there exists a g∈E such that gf∈E
  - (E,M) is reflective precisely when gf∈E and g∈E together imply f∈E.
Note that the left class in any orthogonal factorization system is automatically closed under composition, contains the isomorphisms, and satisfies the property that gf∈Eg and f∈E together imply g∈E. Therefore, (E,M)(E,M) is reflective precisely when EE is a system of weak equivalences

Theorem 3.2. Suppose that C is finitely complete and M-complete for some factorization system (E,M), where M consists of monomorphisms and contains the split monics. Then any reflective prefactorization system on C is a factorization system.
Theorem 3.3. Suppose that C is finitely complete and that (E,M) is a reflective prefactorization system on C such that E-morphisms are stable under pullback along M-morphisms. Then (E,M) is a factorization system.

Liens avec la localisation:
For any favorable prefactorization system (E,M), it is easy to show that M/1 is the localization of C at E. If (E′,M′) is the reflective interior of (E,M), then since E′ is the class of maps inverted by the reflector into M/1, it is precisely the saturation of E in the sense of localization (the class of maps inverted by the localization at E).
Reflective stable factorization systems
A reflective factorization system on a finitely complete category is a stable factorization system if and only if its corresponding reflector preserves finite limits. A stable reflective factorization system is sometimes called local.

Résumé
------

- reflective subcategories are localizations (for W=les morphismes qui
  deviennent des isos via L, ie les morphismes locaux)
- reflective localization reflects onto full subcategory of local objects:
  si la W-localisation existe et est réflective (ie on a un adjoint à
  droite C[W^-1]->C pleinement fidèle), alors L est la réflexion vers les
  objets W-locaux de C.
- Enfin, si CW la catégorie des objets W-locaux est reflective dans C,
  alors par ce qui précède, CW est la localisation de C par rapport aux
  morphismes W-locaux (ce qui inclus W, mais peut-être plus grand; c'est la
  saturation de W).
  Cependant, on a la propriété de localisation suivante sur CW:
  si F est un foncteur adjoint à gauche qui inverse W, alors il
  inverse tous les morphismes W-locaux, donc se factorise par CW.
- Si C a un objet terminal 1, alors LC -> C est une localisation
  réflective, E les morphismes locaux, M=orth de E; alors (M,E) est un
  "favorable prefact system". Récip si (M,E) est un tel système, on a une
  sous-catégorie réflective M/1, et (M',E') est le favorable prefact sytem
  qui correspond à M/1, E' est la saturation de E.
  De plus (M', E') est un fact system si E' est stable par pullback le long
  de M' ou si C est M0-complète pour un système de factorisation (E0,M0) où
  split monic \subset M0 \subset monic.

Epi/Mono
========

- f: A->B est mono ssi Hom(T,A)->Hom(T,B) est mono
- f: A->B est epi ssi Hom(B,T)->Hom(A,T) est mono

f:A->B, g:B->C, h=gof:A->C
Alors f+g mono/épi => h mono/épi
f et h épi => g épi
g et h mono => f mono

Types d'épi
-----------

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/epimorphism
- f: A->B est un épi ssi B est le pushout de f par lui même
  De plus f est stable par pushout

There are a sequence of variations on the concept of epimorphism, which conveniently arrange themselves in a total order. In order from strongest to weakest, we have:
- split epimorphism = morphism having a section
- effective descent morphism
- descent morphism = stable regular epimorphism
- effective epimorphism = coequalizer of its kernel pair
- regular epimorphism = coequalizer of some parallel pair of morphisms
- strict epimorphism = joint coequalizer of all pairs which it coequalizes
- strong epimorphism = an epimorphism right orthogonal to monomorphisms
- extremal epimorphism = an epimorphism not factoring through any nontrivial monomorphism.
- epimorphism.

Equivalence: 
- si C admet les pullbacks, alors Effectif <=> Régulier <=> Strict et Strong <=> Extrémal
  (en effet, si f a un kernel pair, alors f est un coéq ssi c'est le coéq
  de son kernel pair)
- si C régulière, f Extrémal <=> f Morphisme de Descente
  cf http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/descent+morphism, si C rég, f descent <=>
  f régulier, et comme C régulière, f régulier <=> f extrémal)

Th: si f est un épi régulier + un mono alors f est un iso

Pr: 1) En effet, f régulier => f extrémal et f extrémal épi+mono => f iso par définition.
    2) Directement, cf https://qchu.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/regular-and-effective-monomorphisms-and-epimorphisms/
si f coequalize g_1 et g_2, alors f g_1=f g_2, donc g_1=g_2 car f mono, et
donc f est un iso (car l'id se factorise à travers le coequalisateur)

- f: A->B est extrémal épi si f est épi et le seul moyen d'écrire f comme
  mono o morphisme est quand le mono est un iso.
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/extremal+epimorphism
  (Note si f extrémal et C a les équalisateurs, f est un épi extrémal)

- f: A->B est strong épi s'il est épi et orthogonal aux monomorphismes
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strong+epimorphism
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/orthogonality

  Orthogonal: A->>B => il y a un unique morphisme B->C qui fait commuter le diagramme         |   |
              v   v
              C-->D

  Strong => Extrémal, donc si C a les équalisateurs, juste être orthogonal
  aux monos suffit à être un épi
         <= si C admet les pullbacks

  Dans Reflective subcategories, localizations and factorization systems,
  les auteurs disent que si C est finiment complète ou cocomplète, alors
  Mono^perp=StrongEpi et StrongEpi^perp=Mono.

- f:A -> B est épi strict si 'f is the joint coequalizer of all parallel pairs of morphisms that it coequalizes.'
  (<=> f est un coéqualisateur d'une famille non nécessairement petite)
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+epimorphism

- f: A->B est épi régulier si f est un coégalisateur
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+epimorphism

- f: A->B est épi effectif si f est le coégalisateur de son 'kernel pair'
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/effective+epimorphism

  Le kernel pair de f:A->B est simplement le produit fibré A x_B A
  ou encore le pullback de f au-dessus de lui-même
  A x_B A -> A

  A morphism having a kernel pair (such as any morphism in a category
  with pullbacks) is a regular (or even strict) epimorphism if and only if

  Let C be a category with pullbacks.
   The evident internal functor ker(p)→ (viewing B as a discrete internal category) induces a comparison functor C^B \to C^{ker(p)}. We say that p is:
    - a descent morphism if this comparison functor is fully faithful, and
    - an effective descent morphism if this comparison functor is an equivalence of categories.
  Theorem. p:A→B is a descent morphism if and only if p is a stable regular epimorphism.

Closure:
The classes of strict epimorphisms, of familially-strong epimorphisms, of small-familially-strong epimorphisms, of strong epimorphisms, and of (mere) epimorphisms, are each closed under colimits.
In addition, each of these classes except that of strict epimorphisms is closed under composition. Moreover, each of these classes is preserved by any functor S with a right adjoint, since S preserves colimits and its right adjoint T preserves jointly-monomorphic families.
(Par contre regular epi et extremal epi n'ont pas en génréal de bonnes
propriétés de cloture, sauf bien sûr dans les cas où ils sont égaux aux
autres classes.)

Congruence
----------
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/congruence
 A congruence on an object X is an internal equivalence relation on X.
 A congruence which is the kernel pair of some morphism is called effective.
 The coequalizer of a congruence is called a quotient object.
 The quotient of an effective congruence is called an effective quotient.
 A regular category is called an exact category if every congruence is effective.
 Abelian category=Additive category+Exact

Ex: G/K is the quotient of G by the congruence GxK -> GxG
    Comme Group est régulière c'est aussi le quotient de
     G \tens_G/K G -> GxG.
    On a donc G \tens_G/K G \iso GxK, l'iso est
      (g1,g2) -> (g1, g2/g1∈K)

Image et factorisation
======================

Types d'images
--------------

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/image
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/orthogonal+factorization+system

On a deux notions d'image/coimage dans une catégorie admettant
des limites et colimites:
- l'image régulière, qui est l'équalisateur du cokernel pair
- la coimage régulière, qui est est le coequalisateur du kernel pair
- la M-image, qui est le plus petit M-sous-objet tel qu'on se factorise
  A-> Im(f) -> B avec Im(f)->B ∈ M
  Et l'image correspond à M=monomorphismes
- pareil pour la M-coimage

-> ImReg=RegMono-image et CoImReg=RegEpi-coimage:
   In other words, the regular image is the equalizer of the cokernel pair. To see that this is in fact the RegMono-image, we first note that it is of course a regular monomorphism by definition, and then invoke the fact that in a category with finite limits and colimits, a monomorphism is regular if and only if it is the equalizer of its cokernel pair.

-> Dans une catégorie régulière, CoImage-régulière = Image (pour M=monos)

Factorisation system
--------------------

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_system

(M,E) factorisation system si tout morphisme f se décompose en f=e o m
de manière fonctorielle: si e o m et e' o m' sont reliés par un morphisme
(u,v), alors il y a un morphisme w tel que (u,w) soit un morphisme de e->e' et
(w,v) un morphisme de m->m'.

Cette fonctorialité se retraduit en M \subset orthogonal de E, E \subset
orthogonal de M ((M,E) prefact system). En particulier, si E=orthogonal de M, (M,E) est un prefact system.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/weak+factorization+system
Every morphism f:X→Y may be factored as the composition of a morphism in ℒ followed by one in ℛ
The classes are closed under having the lifting property against each other.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/orthogonal+factorization+system
(M,E) OFS si tout morphisme se décompose en eom et
  a. E is precisely the class of morphisms that are left orthogonal to every morphism in M;
  b. M is precisely the class of morphisms that are right orthogonal to every morphism in E.
[en fait si tout morphisme se décompose en e o m, il suffit que
M^orth \subset E <=> E^orth \subset M pour avoir l'équalité]
Ou
  a. The factorization is unique up to unique isomorphism.
  b. E and M both contain all isomorphisms and are closed under composition.

In general, (−)^⊥ and ⊥^(−) form a Galois connection on the poset of classes of morphisms in C. A pair (E,M) such that E= ⊥^M M=E^⊥ is sometimes called a prefactorization system

Prop:
- A weak factorization system (L,R) is an orthogonal factorization system precisely if L⊥R.
- For (L,R) an orthogonal factorization system in a category C, the intersection L∩R is precisely the class of isomorphisms in C.
- M contains the isomorphisms and is closed under composition and pullback (insofar as pullbacks exist in C).
- If a composite gof is in M, and f is either in M or a monomorphism, then g is in M.
- M is closed under all limits in the arrow category Arr(C).

* Relation avec la M-image:

Suppose that M is closed under composition, and that f=me is an image factorization relative to M. Then e has the property that if e=ng for some n∈M, then n is an isomorphism — for then we would have f=(mn)g and so by universality of images, m would factor through mn. In particular, if M is the class of all monomorphisms and C has equalizers, then e is an extremal epimorphism.
If C has pullbacks and M is closed under pullbacks, then we can say more: e is orthogonal to M.

Conversely, it is easy to see that if (E,M) is an OFS on a category C, then all M-images exist and are given by the factorizations of the OFS. Therefore, to give a notion of image is more or less equivalent to giving an orthogonal factorization system.

Exemple: dans une catégorie régulière (regular épi, mono) est un OFS.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+factorization+system
Cf localisation.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/M-complete+category#OFSFromAdjunction
Let C be a category and let M be a class of monomorphisms in C. (Often, M will be the right class in an orthogonal factorization system.) We say that C is M-complete if it admits all (even large) intersections of M-subobjects. This means that it admits all (even large) wide pullbacks of families of M-morphisms, and such pullbacks are again in M. (If M is the right class of an OFS, then any intersection of M-morphisms which exists is automatically in M.)

Theorem 4.1. Let M be a class of maps in a category C, and assume that
  - M consists of monomorphisms,
  - M is closed under composition,
  - all pullbacks of M-morphisms exist in C and are again in M, and
  - C is M-complete.
Then there is an orthogonal factorization system (E,M), with E= ⊥^M.

Note that if M is already part of a prefactorization system, then any composite, pullback, or intersection (or produits, produits fibrés) of M-morphisms which exists is automatically also in M, since M=E^⊥. De plus si gof ∈ M et G ∈ M alors f ∈ M.

Corollary 4.2. Let (E,M) be a prefactorization system on a category C, and assume that
  - M consists of monomorphisms,
  - All pullbacks of M-morphisms exist in C, and
  - C is M-complete.
Then (E,M) is an orthogonal factorization system.

Theorem 4.3. Let S:A⇄C:T be an adjunction, and assume that A is finitely complete and M-complete for some OFS (E,M), where M consists of monomorphisms and contains the split monics. Define E_S to be the class of maps inverted by S, and M_S=(E_S)^⊥; then (E_S,M_S) is an OFS on A.

Strong-Epi, Mono factorisation system
-------------------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28epi%2C+mono%29+factorization+system

* https://qchu.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/epi-mono-factorizations/
   The category of epi-mono factorizations of a morphism is a preorder, ie
   is a lift $g$ exists it is unique. Moreover, the morphisms g in the category are both monomorphisms and epimorphisms (=fake iso).
   Theorem: Suppose that a category C has either pushouts or pullbacks. Moreover, suppose that C has no fake isomorphisms (e.g. because all monomorphisms are regular or because all epimorphisms are regular). Then epi-mono factorizations in C are unique (up to unique isomorphism).

* (RegEpi, Mono)
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1652019/is-composition-of-regular-epimorphisms-always-regular
In a category with all kernel pairs and coequalisers of kernel pairs, the following conditions are equivalent:
  - regular epimorphisms are stable under composition;
  - regular epimorphisms coincide with strong epimorphisms;
  - for any morphism f, if m_f∘e_f is its factorisation through the coequaliser of its kernel pair, m_f is a monomorphism;
  - regular epimorphisms and monomorphisms form a factorisation system.

* (StrongEpi, Mono):
SOME REMARKS ON CONSERVATIVE FUNCTORS WITH LEFT ADJOINTS
PROPOSITION 3.1. Consider the following assertions:
( i) (SEpi, Mon) factorizations exist.
(ii) If f : A->B factorizes through no proper subobject of B, it is a strong epimorphism.
(iii) If f : A->B factorizes through no proper strong epimorphism q: A->D, it is a monomorphism.
Then (i) implies (ii) and (iii), while (ii) implies (i) if C admits arbitrary intersections of monomorphisms, and (iii) implies (i) if C admits arbitrary cointersections of strong epimorphisms.

Prop: - si C a les pullbacks et (equalisers or pushouts), alors (ii)
      - si C a les coéqus OU les pushouts+pullbacks, alors (iii)

Th: Equalisers + Pullbacks + Arbitrary intersection of monos
 OR Coeqs + Arbitrary cointersections of strong epimorphisms.
 => (StrongEpi, Mono) factorisation
 (et de plus Strong Epi => Familial Strong [dans le premier cas si on a les
 produits finis en plus]; dans le deuxième cas on a même une factorisation
 en famille: f_i: A->B_i se factorise en f_i=m_i o e avec e strong épi et

* Cas usuel 1: cf Reflective subcategories, localizations and factorization systems

LEMMA 3.1. Let M a class of monomorphisms in C, closed under composition;
let C admit all pullbacks (along any map) of maps in M, and all intersections of
maps in M; and let these pullbacks and intersections again belong to M. Then
(M^perp , M) is a factorization system.

Cor: (Epi, StrMono) is a fact system if C is finitely well-complete
(=finite limits + all intersections of strong mono) OR C finitely
cocomplete et a toutes les cointersections d'épi OR C est finitely complète
et cocomplète et les strongs mono sont réguliers.

Donc (StrEpi, Mono) fact system si C est finiment cocomplète+toutes les
cointersections de strong épis OR C finiment complète et a toutes les
intersections de monos OR C est finiment complète et cocomplète et les
strongs épis sont réguliers.

C complète et on suppose que C a les coeqs de ses kernels pairs. 
On veut construire un (StrEpi, Mono) fact system, ie on veut factoriser f
en strepi o mono. Via le coeq, on écrit f=f_1 e_1 où e_1 est régulier.
Si f_1 = mono alors on a gagné, sinon on itère de manière transfinie (on
peut si l'on suppose C cocomplète).
Si C est extremally well co-powered (=there is only a set of extremal
quotients) alors la récursion fini par un iso, ce qui veut dire que f_alpha

Donc: If A is cocomplete, finitely complete, and extremally well-copowered, then ( StrEpi , Mono) is an orthogonal factorization system. 

[Note: il me semble que les limites utilisées dans la preuve ne supposent que l'existence de coeqs de kernels pair, et de colimites filtrantes.

     Dually C has an (epi, strong mono) factorisation system, if it is complete, well powered, and has pushouts.
     If C is a loc. presentable category , it satisfy both conditions.
]

Ternary factorisation system
----------------------------
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ternary+factorization+system
A ternary factorization system on C to consist of a pair (L_1,R_1) and (L_2,R_2) of ordinary orthogonal factorization systems such that L_1⊆L_2 (or equivalently R_2⊆R_1)
Proposition. Given a ternary factorization system as above, any morphism f factors as A→L_1 im_2(f)→L_2∩R_1 im_1(f)→R_2 B
in an essentially unique way, ie on a un  (L_1, L_2∩R_1, R_2) fact system.
Preuve: First factoring f into an L_1-map followed by an R_1-map, then factoring the R_1-part into an L_2-map followed by an R_2-map; and
First factoring f into an L_2-map followed by an R_2-map, then factoring the L_2-part into an L_1-map followed by an R_1-map give the same factorisation.

Conversely, just as for a binary factorization system, the extra
requirement of orthogonality can be deduced from uniqueness of the
factorizations, a unique and functorial ternary factorization implies that
it “splits” into a pair of binary factorization systems

Class R_2L_1: morphismes dont la partie L_2∩R_1 est un iso, ie qui se
factorisent comme L_1 puis R_2. 
Proposition. In a ternary factorization system, L_1=L_2∩R_2L_1 and R_2=R_1∩R_2L_1.

Exemples:
- In Top, let L_1= quotient maps, R_1= injective continuous maps, L_2= surjective continuous functions, and R_2= subspace embeddings. Here L_2∩R_1 bijective continuous maps, and the two intermediate objects in the ternary factorization of a continuous map are obtained by imposing the coarsest and the finest compatible topologies on its set-theoretic image.
- More generally, if a category has both (epi, strong mono) and (strong epi, mono) factorizations, then since strong epis are epi, we have a ternary factorization. Here L_2∩R_1 is the class of monic epics, sometimes called bimorphisms. The maps in R_2 L_1 are sometimes called strict morphisms.
- On Cat there is a 2-categorical version of a ternary factorization system, determined by the 2-categorical factorization systems (eso+full, faithful) and (eso, full and faithful). Here L_2∩R_1 is the class of eso+faithful functors, while R_2L_1 is the class of full functors. This factorization system plays an important role in the study of stuff, structure, property.
- On Topos there is also a 2-categorical ternary factorization system composed of the binary 2-categorical factorization systems (hyperconnected, localic) and (surjection = surjective geom morphism, inclusion = geometric embedding).

Relations entre Im et CoIm
--------------------------

Cf aussi ternary factorisation system.

Ici Im(f) c'est la M-image pour M=mono
On suppose que le kernel pair et cokernel pair existent, ainsi que leur
coeq:=CoImReg resp eq:=ImReg. On suppose aussi que l'image et la coimage
existent.

A ->> CoImReg(f) ->> Im(f) -?> CoIm(f) --> ImReg(f) --> B
et f est strict si CoImReg(f) -> ImReg(f) est un iso

- A -> Im f --> B, avec A -> Im f extrémal, donc un épi extrémal si C a les éqs.
- A ->> CoIm f -> B, avec CoIm f -> B extrémal, donc un mono extrémal si C a les coéqs.
- Donc éqs+coéqs: A ->> Im f -->> CoIm f --> B
  où A->>Im f et CoIm f --> B extrémal
- Si f s'écrit A -g> X -->B, alors CoImReg f=CoImReg g
  Donc on a: 
  A ->> CoImReg(f) ->> Im(f) -->> CoIm(f) --> ImReg(f) --> B
    reg          extrémal  mono+épi    extrémal       régulier
- si C est régulière, CoImReg f --> B, donc CoImReg=Im
  donc si C est régulière+corégulière
  A ->> CoImReg(f)=Im(f) -->> CoIm(f)=ImReg(f) --> B

- Factorisation system: CoImReg pour RegEpi/Mono; ImReg pour Epi/RegMono

Morphisme strict: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+morphism
A strict morphism is a morphism for which the notion of regular image and regular coimage coincide, ie reg-coim f -> reg-im f est un iso.
Ex: dans un topos ou une catégorie abélienne, tout morphisme est strict.
Exemple: si f:c->d est un épi, d est sa propre image régulière, définie comme la
limite RegIm f≃lim(d ⇉ d ⊔_c d), donc il est strict si il est régulier, ie
si c'est une coimage.

Types de catégories
===================

Taille
------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+small+category
each of its hom-sets is a small set,

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/well-powered+category
every object has a small poset of subobjects.
- A well-powered category with binary products is always locally small, since morphisms f:A→B can be identified with particular subobjects of A×B (their graphs).
- Conversely, any locally small category with a subobject classifier must obviously be well-powered. In particular, a topos is locally small if and only if it is well-powered

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/253927/a-category-with-a-strong-generator-is-well-powered
Johnstone [Sketches of an elephant, Remark A1.4.17]:
locally small category with finite intersections of subobjects and a (strong) generating set is well-powered.

Note: well-powered => regularly co-well-powered (en effet un épi régulier
est donné comme un noyau de Ax_BA qui est un sous-objet de AxA).

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/skeleton
A category is skeletal if objects that are isomorphic are necessarily
equal.
A skeleton of a category C is defined to be a skeletal subcategory of C whose inclusion functor exhibits it as equivalent to C.
Skeletally small => the skeletal subcategory is small

Total category
--------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/total+category
A locally small category C is total if its Yoneda embedding Y:C⟶[C^op,Set] has a left adjoint L (=> it is complete).
If the opposite category C^{op} is total, C is called cototal.
=> Since the Yoneda embedding is a full and faithful functor, a total category C induces an idempotent monad Y∘L on its category of presheaves

Propriété: C est complète et cocomplète (et admet même certaines limites
large, cf "G. M. KELLY A survey of totality for enriched and ordinary categories").
Pr: c'est une sous-catégorie reflective de PSh, qui est complète et cocomplète.

Proposition 4.1. Any cocomplete and epi-cocomplete category with a (small set) generator is total. More generally, any cocomplete and E-complete category with an E-generator is total, for a suitable class E.
-> locally presentable categories, hence in particular Grothendieck toposes [they are also cototal], or the category of abelian sheaves on a small site.

Cor (cf Kelly): C est réflexive dans une catégorie de préfaisceaux [B^op,
Set] avec B small [=> C totale] ssi C est cocomplète et a une catégorie
small dense; c'est le cas si C est loc. présentable.
Pr: <= Comme C est cocomplète, le foncteur yoneda_restriction à un adjoint à
gauche.

Th: totality lifts along solid functors; that is, if the codomain of a solid functor is total, then so is its domain
- any reflective subcategory of a total category
- any category which is monadic over Set
- any category admitting a topological functor to Set
=>
- The category Grp of groups as a category monadic over Set is total
- The category of topological groups is total as well since it is topological over the total category Grp.
- If C is total and J is small, then C^J is total, morally because it is a reflective subcategory of Set^{C^op×J}

En particulier, une catégorie réflexive dans une catégorie de préfaisceau
est totale.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lex+total+category
A lex total category ℰ is a Grothendieck topos iff ℰ has a small set of generators.

Theorem 2.3. (Street) A category E is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is κ or less.

Closed category
---------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/closed+category
A un internal hom (qui satisfait des conditions de compatibilités, c'est
plus compliqué que de le définir comme dual du produit comme pour les
cartesian closed categories)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/closed+monoidal+category
A closed monoidal category C is a monoidal category that is also a closed category, in a compatible way:
it has for each object X a functor (−)⊗X:C→C(-) of forming the tensor product with X, as well as a functor [X,−]:C→C of forming the internal-hom with X, and these form a pair of adjoint functors.
Hom(a⊗b,c)≃Hom(a,[b,c]),

Cartesian category
------------------

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finitely+complete+category
A category is finitely complete (cartesian dans Elephant) if and only if:
- It admits all finite limits
- It has a terminal object and admits all binary products and equalizers; or
- It has a terminal object and admits all binary pullbacks.

Cartesian closed category
-------------------------

Cartesian closed: admet les limites (finies), et a les exponentielles (définies
comme le dual du produit: Hom(XxY,Z)=Hom(X,Hom(Y,Z))
On a Z^(XxY)=Z^X x Z^Y car Z^ étant un adjoint il commute aux limites.
Z^(Y^X)=(Z^Y)^X via l'adjonction.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+cartesian+closed+category
C/x est cartesian closed pour tout objet x dans C.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+closed+functor
preserves both products and exponential objects/internal homs
Proposition 3.1. For 𝒞 a locally cartesian closed category and f:X_1→X_2 a morphism, the base change/pullback functor between the slice categories f *:𝒞 /X_2→𝒞 /X_1 is cartesian closed.

Proposition 2.1. (Frobenius reciprocity)
Let R:𝒞→𝒟 be a functor between cartesian closed categories with a left adjoint LL. Then R is cartesian closed precisely if the natural transformation
(Lπ_1,ϵ_ALπ_2):L(B×R(A))→L(B)×A is an isomorphism.

Locally regular category
-------------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+regular+category
A locally regular category is a relative of a regular category in which the condition of finite limits is weakened to finite connected limits. It is so named because every slice category of a locally regular category is a regular category

A category C is locally regular if
  - It has finite connected limits — equivalently, it has pullbacks and equalizers;
  - It has (extremal epi, mono) factorizations which are stable under pullback; and
  - Every span factors as an extremal epi followed by a jointly-monic span.

A locally regular category is regular if and only if it has a terminal object.

The factorization axiom for spans implies, by induction, a similar factorization property for nonempty finite cosinks. However, similar factorizations for empty cosinks (i.e. “supports”) do not necessarily exist.

Regular category
----------------

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_category
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+category

C'est une catégorie qui admet les pullbacks (=> all finite limits si on a
un objet final, mais c'est les pullbacks qui nous intéressent) et telle
que
- tout kernel pair A x_B A => B admet un conoyau
  [déjà dans une catégorie satisfaisant ces deux propriétés, un
  coéqualisateur D=>A->B est le coéqualisateur de son kernel pair
  A x_B A => B]

  (ie tous les épi réguliers sont de descente)

f:x→_e im(f)→_i y, where e is a regular epimorphism and i a monomorphism.

  Effective descent morphisms of regular epimorphisms
  Tomas Everaert
    Let A be a regular category with pushouts of regular epimorphisms by
    regular epimorphism and Reg(A) the category of regular epimorphisms in
    A. We prove that every regular epimorphism in Reg(A) is an effective
    descent morphism if, and only if, Reg(A) is a regular category. Then,
    moreover, every regular epimorphism in A is an effective descent
    morphism. This is the case, for instance, when A is either exact
    Goursat, or ideal determined, or is a category of topological Mal'tsev
    algebras, or is the category of n-fold regular epimorphisms in any of
    the three previous cases, for any n≥1

Additive = Protomodular + pointed + every mono is normal.
Abelian = Exact + Additive

Plus exactement:
Th 5.10: C finitely complete, then additive <=> pointed, protomodular, every mono normal.

$ 6. The Short Five Lemma and the Tierney equation
6.1. Definition. [9] [12] A category C is abelian if
(1) C has a zero object
(2) C has binary products and binary coproducts
(3) every arrow has a kernel and a cokernel
(4) every monomorphism is a kernel, every epimorphism is a cokernel
Note: ça implique automatiquement que C est additive!

Theorem 2.17 Barr-Kock theorem

Exact category
--------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exact+category
An exact category (in the sense of Barr) is a regular category in which every congruence is a kernel pair (that is, every internal equivalence relation is effective). Exact categories are also called effective regular categories.
Exemples:
- Any topos is an exact category.
- Any category which is monadic over a power of Set is exact.
- Any abelian category is exact. In fact an abelian category is precisely an exact additive category.

Extensive category
------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/extensive+category
  A finitely extensive category (or finitary extensive category) is a category E with finite coproducts such that one, and hence all, of the following equivalent conditions holds:
  - Pullbacks of finite-coproduct injections along arbitrary morphisms exist and finite coproducts are disjoint and stable under pullback.
  -  For any objects a,b the coproduct functor E/a×E/b→E/(a+b) is an equivalence of categories.
  - In any commutative diagram
    x → z ← y 
    ↓   ↓   ↓ 
    a →a+b← b
    the two squares are pullbacks if and only if the top row is a coproduct diagram.
  - Finite coproducts are van Kampen colimits. By definition, this is to say one of the previous two conditions (depending on the definition chosen).

$ Remarks:
- the alternative definitions of finitary disjunctive refer only to binary coproducts, but they obviously imply analogous statements for n-ary coproducts for all finite n≥1. Less obviously, they also imply the analogous statement for 0-ary coproducts (that is, initial objects). In this case, the statement is that the initial object 0 is strict (any map a→0 is an isomorphism).
- Furthermore, if binary coproducts are disjoint, then (at least assuming classical logic) any infinitary coproducts that exist are also disjoint, since
⨆_a∈A X_a≅X_a_0⊔ ⨆_a≠a_0 X_a≅X_a_0⊔X_a_1⊔ ⨆_a≠a_0,a_1 X_a for any a_0,a_1∈A. Therefore, if a finitary-extensive category has infinitary pullback-stable coproducts, it is necessarily infinitary-extensive. In particular, a cocomplete locally cartesian closed category is finitary extensive if and only if it is infinitary extensive.
- As a further special case of the preceding, since an elementary topos is finitary extensive, any cocomplete elementary topos is infinitary extensive. However, in this case, one of the arguments for finitary extensivity applies directly to the infinitary case and does not require classical logic; see toposes are extensive.

$ Examples
  - An elementary topos is finitary lextensive; a Grothendieck topos (or, more generally, any cocomplete elementary topos) is infinitary lextensive.
  - A quasitopos with disjoint coproducts, or more generally a locally cartesian closed category with disjoint coproducts, is extensive.

$ Pre-extensive:
- it has a strict initial object 0 (equivalently, its subobject preorders have pullback-stable bottom elements), and
- whenever A↣X and B↣X are disjoint subobjects (i.e. A∩B=0A\cap B=0), they have a pullback-stable union (which is then automatically a disjoint and stable coproduct).

Regular/exact categories have quotients of (some) congruences. Exact categories have quotients of all congruences, while regular ones have quotients only of congruences that are kernel pairs. Another way to say that is that in a regular category, you can conclude that the quotient of some congruence exists if you can exhibit another object of which the quotient would be a subobject if it existed. Similarly, pre-/lextensive categories have disjoint unions. Lextensive categories have all disjoint unions (= coproducts), while in a pre-lextensive category you can conclude that a pair of objects X,Y have a disjoint union if you can exhibit another object in which X and Y can be embedded disjointly. Finally, coherent categories/pretoposes have both quotients and disjoint unions, or equivalently quotients and not-necessarily-disjoint unions, with the same sort of relationship between the two.

Coherent category
-----------------
Regular + pre-lextensive [Hum: pre-lextensive donne juste l'union de deux
sous-objets distincts, est-ce qu'on peut utiliser la régularité pour avoir
l'union quelconque?]
A coherent category (also called a pre-logos) is a regular category in which the subobject posets Sub(X) all have finite unions which are preserved by the base change functors

An infinitary coherent category is a regular category in which the subobject posets Sub(X) have all small unions which are stable under pullback. Infinitary coherent categories are also called geometric categories.

Elephant: si C régulière + a coproduit, alors C a les unions (finies) de sous-objets; en effet C/A a les coproduits (crée par C), donc Sub(A) qui est réflective
aussi.

Soit C une catégorie cohérente, 1 l'objet terminal, et 0 l'objet initial de Sub(1). Alors 0 est un objet initial strict. (A_1) \cap (A_2 \cup A_3)=(A_1 \cap A_2) \cup (A_1 \cap A_3). 
A_1 \cap A_2 -> A_1          est un pullback et un pushout dans C.

 v
A_2          -> A_1 \cup A_2

k-ary exact category
--------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%CE%BA-ary+exact+category
Let C be a finitely complete category. By a sink in C we mean a family {f_i:A_i→B} of morphisms with common target. A sink is extremal epic if it doesn’t factor through any proper subobject of B. The pullback of a sink along a morphism B′→B is defined in the evident way.
By a (many-object) relation in C we will mean a family of objects {A_i} together with, for every i,j∈I, a monic span A_i←R_ij→A_j (that is, a subobject R_ij of A_i×A_j. We say such a relation is:
  - reflexive if R_ii contains the diagonal A_i→A_i×A_i
  - transitive if the pullback R_ij× A_j R_jk factors through R_ik
  - symmetric if R_ij contains, hence is equal to, the transpose of R_ji
  - a congruence if it is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric; this is an internal notion of (many-object) equivalence relation.
A quotient for a relation is a colimit for the diagram consisting of all the A_i and all the spans A_i←R_ij→A_j. And the kernel of a sink {f_i:A i→B} is the relation on A_i with R_ij=A_i×_BA_j. It is evidently a congruence.
Finally, a sink is called effective-epic if it is the quotient of its kernel. It is called universally effective-epic if any pullback of it is effective-epic.

Theorem 3.1. For a category C, the following are equivalent:
  - C has finite limits, every κ-ary sink in C factors as an extremal epic sink followed by a monomorphism, and the pullback of any extremal epic κ-ary sink is extremal epic.
  - C has finite limits, and the kernel of any κ-ary sink in C is also the kernel of some universally effective-epic sink.
  - C is a regular category and has pullback-stable joins of κ-small families of subobjects.

Theorem 3.2. For a category C, the following are equivalent:
  - C has finite limits, and every κ-ary congruence is the kernel of some universally effective-epic sink.
  - C is κ-ary regular, and every κ-ary congruence is the kernel of some sink.
  - C is both exact and κ-ary extensive.

Examples
- C is regular iff it is unary regular.
- C is coherent iff it is finitary regular.
- C is infinitary-coherent iff it is well-powered and infinitary regular.
- C is exact iff it is unary exact.
- C is a pretopos iff it is finitary exact.
- C is an infinitary pretopos iff it is well-powered and infinitary exact.

Prop:
  In a κ-ary regular category,
    Every extremal-epic κ-ary sink is the quotient of its kernel.
    Any κ-ary congruence that is a kernel has a quotient.
  Thus, in a κ-ary exact category,
    Every κ-ary congruence has a quotient.
  In a κ-ary regular category, the class of all κ-small and effective-epic families generates a topology, called its κ-canonical topology. This topology makes it a ∞-ary site.

Complétion
----------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Karoubi+envelope
The Karoubi envelope or idempotent completion of a category is the universal enlargement of the category with the property that every idempotent is a split idempotent. This is the Set-enriched version of the more general notion of Cauchy completion of an enriched category.

Theorem 4.1. The subcategory i:Open↪Manifolds exhibits Manifolds as an idempotent-splitting completion of Open.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cauchy+complete+category
For C a small category there is an equivalence of categories
C¯≃Topos_ess(Set,[C,Set])^op
of its Cauchy completion, def. 2.1, with the category of essential points of [C,Set].

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Freyd-Mitchell+embedding+theorem
The Freyd–Mitchell embedding theorem says that every abelian category is a full subcategory of a category of modules over some ring R and that the embedding is an exact functor.

Theorem 2.3. Let C be an abelian category. If C has all small coproducts and has a compact projective generator, then C≃RMod for some ring R.
In fact, in this situation we can take R=C(x,x)^{op} where x is any compact
projective generator. Conversely, if C≃RMod, then C has all small
coproducts and x=R is a compact projective generator.

Watts’ Theorem 2.4. If B is an an S-R-bimodule, the tensor product functor
B⊗_R−:RMod→SMod is right exact and preserves small coproducts. Conversely, if F:Mod_R→Mod_S is right exact and that preserves small coproducts, it is naturally isomorphic to B⊗_R− where B is the S-R-bimodule FR.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Barr+embedding+theorem
If a category is small and regular, then there exists an embedding, which is a full, faithful and regular, into a category of presheaves over some small category.

* Généralisation: cf http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/embed.pdf

Verdier: X est une catégorie, on a un full embedding R:X->E dans un topos E où E=Sh(X, topologie canonique). R préserve les épis réguliers universels (ie f: A->B est un épi régulier, et le pullback de f existe toujours et reste stable par pullbacks); si X a les pullbacks R les réflète aussi.

For general X, it might happen that Rf is an epimorphism when, for lack of
enough pullbacks, is not a universal regular epimorphism. For example it
might be a split epimorphism — a property preserved by every functor. 

Déf: on dit que f est un R-universal regular épi si Rf est universal regular 
[ie si Rf est un épi car dans un topos, universal regular épi=régular épi=épi.]
(Donc si X est régulière, R-universal regular épi = universal régular épi=regular épi=extrémal épi.)
Déf: f est dit 'R-exact' si il préserve les limites finies et les
morphismes R-universal regular. Il est dit 'R-reflexively-exact' si de plus
il reflète les limites finies et les R-épi réguliers universels.

Ainsi R:X->E est fully faithfull et 'R-reflexively-exact'.
On applique l'embedding de Barr à E, et on obtient qu'il existe une small
category X' et un embedding fully faithfull et 'R-reflexively-exact' vers [X'^op, Set] (Th A).

Corollaires:
Th B. Let X be a small category. Then there is a (discrete) set I and a functor U:X->Set^I which is faithful and R-reflexively exact.
Theorem C. Let X be a small category. Then there is a family {U_i} of exact set-valued functors on X which collectively are faithful and reflect finite limits and R-universal regular epimorphisms.

Application: on peut faire du diagramme chasing en se ramenant à Set pour montrer: si on a un diagramme commutatif f: X_1->X_2
                                   g: Y_1->Y_2
où f est un morphisme R-universel régulier épi tel que le kernel pair de f
soit un pullback du kernel pair de g:
XX => X_1 -> X_2
YY => Y_1 -> Y_2
alors f est un pullback de g.

* Embedding of topos
https://ncatlab.org/spahn/files/aspects_of_topoi.pdf
Aspects of topoi, Peter Freyd
After a review of the work of Lawvere and Tierney, it is shown that every topos may be exactly embedded in a product of topoi each with 1 as a generator, and near-exactly embedded in a power of the category of set.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+and+exact+completions

The forgetful 2-functors
- from regular categories to lex categories (lex=finitely complete),
- from exact categories to lex categories, and
- from exact categories to regular categories
have left adjoints, and in fact are (2-)monadic. Their left adjoints are called (free) regular or exact completions.
In the third case the 2-monad is idempotent, so the left adjoint can properly be called a completion, while in the first two cases, the 2-monad is only lax-idempotent, so the left adjoint should technically be called a free completion.

C_ex/lex is the full subcategory of its presheaf category spanned by those presheaves F such that
  - FF admits a regular epimorphism y(X)↠F
  - with the additional property that if K⇉y(X) is the kernel pair of y(X)↠F, then K also admits a regular epi y(Z)↠K.

The reg/lex completion C_reg/lex of a lex category C is perhaps most succinctly described as the subcategory of C_ex consisting of those objects which admit monomorphisms into objects of C, ie:
- F admits a regular epimorphism y(X)↠F
- F admits a monomorphism F↣y(Z)

If C is regular, a quick definition of C_ex/reg is as the full subcategory of the category Sh(C) of sheaves for the regular coverage on C spanned by those sheaves which are quotients of congruences in C

EXACT COMPLETIONS AND SMALL SHEAVES MICHAEL SHULMAN
We prove a general theorem which includes most notions of “exact
completion” as special cases.  The theorem is that “κ-ary exact
categories” are a reflective sub-2-category of “κ-ary sites”, for any
regular cardinal κ.  A κ-ary exact category is an exact category with
disjoint and universal κ-small coproducts, and a κ-ary site is a site
whose covering sieves are generated by κ -small families and which
satisfies a solution-set condition for finite limits relative to κ.

In the unary case, this includes the exact completions of a regular
category, of a category with (weak) finite limits, and of a category with a
factorization system.  When κ = ω, it includes the pretopos completion of
a coherent category.  And when κ = K is the size of  the  universe,  it
includes  the  category  of  sheaves  on  a  small  site,  and  the
category of small presheaves on a locally small and finitely complete
category.  The K-ary exact completion of a large nontrivial site gives a
well-behaved “category of small sheaves”.

Pretopos
--------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pretopos
A pretopos is a category which is both exact and extensive.
A Π-pretopos is a pretopos which is also a locally cartesian closed category.
(loc. cartesian closed: C/a est cartesian closed pour tout objet a de C)
A topos is a pretopos that has power objects. A topos is automatically a Π-pretopos; conversely, a Π-pretopos is a topos iff it has a subobject classifier

A pretopos is necessarily balanced, but while it has coproducts and coequalizers of equivalence relations, it need not have all finite colimits.
However, if it has countable pullback-stable unions of subobjects, then any internal binary relation generates an equivalence relation and therefore has a quotient, so we can construct arbitrary coequalizers and thus arbitrary finite colimits.

An infinitary pretopos is an infinitary coherent category which is both infinitary extensive and exact. Giraud's theorem says that infinitary pretoposes with small generating sets are the same as Grothendieck toposes, and in particular are toposes (although this last result is not valid in predicative mathematics).

Elephant, Lemme 1.4.8: dans un prétopos, si A-->B, et A-->C, on a un
pushout A-->B,C --> D. (Et A est le pushout square est aussi un pullback
square). Corollaire 1.4.9: tous les monos/épis sont réguliers.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quasitopos
Definition. A quasitopos is a finitely complete, finitely cocomplete, locally cartesian closed category E in which there exists an object Ω that classifies strong monomorphisms.
Déf: Let C be a category with two Grothendieck topologies J and K such that J⊆K. The full subcategory BiSep(C,J,K)↪PSh(C) of the category of presheaves over C consisting of the sheaves for J that are also separated for K is a quasitopos.
Corollary. A quasitopos that is also a balanced category is a topos.

## Catégorie monoïdale

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherence+theorem+for+monoidal+categories
The coherence theorem for monoidal categories, like many coherence theorems, has several forms (or, alternatively, refers to several different theorems):
  - Every “formal” diagram in a monoidal category made up of associators and unitors commutes.
  - Every diagram in a free monoidal category made up of associators and unitors commutes.
  - The free monoidal category on some given data is equivalent to the free strict monoidal category on the same data.
  - Every monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict monoidal category.
  - Every monoidal category is equivalent to an unbiased monoidal category?.
  - The forgetful 2-functor StrMonCat→MonCatStrMonCat \to MonCat has a strict left adjoint and the components of the unit are equivalences in MonCatMonCat.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherence+theorem+for+symmetric+monoidal+categories
The coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories, like many coherence theorems, has several forms (or, alternatively, refers to several different theorems):
  - Every diagram in a free symmetric monoidal category made up of associators and unitors and symmetries (braidings), and in which both sides have the same underlying permutation, commutes.
  - The free symmetric monoidal category on some given data is equivalent to the free symmetric strict monoidal category on the same data.
  - Every symmetric monoidal category is symmetric-monoidally equivalent to a symmetric strict monoidal category.
  - Every symmetric monoidal category is equivalent to an unbiased symmetric monoidal category?.
  - The forgetful 2-functor SymStrMonCat→SymMonCatSymStrMonCat \to SymMonCat has a strict left adjoint and the components of the unit are equivalences in SymMonCatSymMonCat.

Note that in a symmetric strict monoidal category, the associators and unitors are identities, but the symmetry is not in general.

Voir aussi: https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Closed+structure+on+modules+over+a+commutative+monoid
Theorem (Kelly-Mac Lane). Let F=F[a,b,c,…] be the free symmetric monoidal closed category generated by a countably infinite set of letters. Let f,g:X→Y be morphisms in F between unit-free words where each letter occurring in var(X)+var(Y) occurs exactly twice. Then f=g.

For example, by this theorem there is exactly one morphism in F of shape
[b,a]⊗b→a
(namely the internal evaluation map). In this example, the morphism is natural in the variable a and extranatural in the variable b; in general, the two occurrences of each letter appearing in the domain/codomain of such “every-variable-twice” morphisms are connected via naturality or extranaturality, so the theorem roughly says that any two smc-definable transformations having the same (extra)natural form must be equal – a kind of coherence theorem.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+monoidal+category
= monoidal structure is given by the category-theoretic product 

Cartesian monoidal categories have a number of special and important properties, such as the existence of diagonal maps Δ_x:x→x⊗x and augmentations e_x:x→I for any object x. In applications to computer science we can think of Δ as ‘duplicating data’ and e as ‘deleting’ data. These maps make any object into a comonoid. In fact, any object in a cartesian monoidal category becomes a comonoid in a unique way.

Moreover, one can show (e.g. Heunen-Vicary 12, p. 84) that any symmetric monoidal category equipped with suitably well-behaved diagonals and augmentations must in fact be cartesian monoidal.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/semicartesian+monoidal+category
A monoidal category is semicartesian if the unit for the tensor product is a terminal object, a weakening of the concept of cartesian monoidal category.

The internal logic of a (symmetric) semicartesian monoidal category is affine logic, which is like linear logic but permits the weakening rule (and also the exchange rule, if the monoidal structure is symmetric).

In a semicartesian monoidal category, any tensor product of objects x⊗yx \otimes y comes equipped with morphisms
p_x:x⊗y→x, p_y:x⊗y→y
We can thus ask whether p_x and p_y make x⊗y into the product of x and y. If so, it is a theorem that CC is a cartesian monoidal category. (This theorem has been observed by Eilenberg and Kelly (1966, p.551)

## Monoïdes
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoid
Catégorie monoïdale = objet en monoïde dans Cat.

- A monoid in which every element has an inverse is a group. For that reason monoids are often known (especially outside category theory) as semi-groups. (But this term is often extended to monoids without identities, that is to sets equipped with any associative operation.)
- A monoid object in Ab (with the usual tensor product of ℤ-modules as the tensor product) is a ring. A monoid object in the category of vector spaces over a field kk (with the usual tensor product of vector spaces) is an algebra over kk.
  (si on prend un monoïde dans Ab pour le produit cartésien, on a un groupe
  commutatif)
- For a commutative ring RR, a monoid object in the category of RR-modules (with its usual tensor product) is an RR-algebra.
- A monoid object in Top (with cartesian product as the tensor product) is a topological monoid.
- A monoid object in Ho(Top) is an H-monoid.
- A monoid object in the category of monoids (with cartesian product as the tensor product) is a commutative monoid. This is a version of the Eckmann-Hilton argument.
- A monoid object in the category of complete join-semilattices (with its tensor product that represents maps preserving joins in each variable separately) is a unital quantale.
- Given any monoidal category C, a monoid in the monoidal category C^{op} is called a comonoid in C.
- In a cocartesian monoidal category, every object is a monoid object in a unique way.
- For any category C, the endofunctor category C^C has a monoidal structure induced by composition of endofunctors, and a monoid object in C^C is a monad on C.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eckmann-Hilton+argument
The Eckmann–Hilton argument shows that a monoid or group object in the category of monoids or groups is commutative. In other terms, if a set is equipped with two monoid structures, such that one is a homomorphism for the other, then the two structures coincide and the resulting monoid is commutative.

En particulier: Let C be a 2-category and x∈C an object. Write Id_x for the identity morphism of X and End(Id_x) for the set of endo-2-morphisms on X. Then:
  - horizontal composition and vertical composition define the same monoid object structure on End(Id_x)
  -  this is an abelian monoid.

A more general version is this: If a set is equipped with two binary operations with identity elements, as long as they commute with each other in the sense that one is (with respect to the other) a homomorphism of sets with binary operations, then everything else follows:
- the other is also a homomorphism with respect to the first;
- each also preserves the other's identity;
- the identities are the same;
- the operations are the same;
- the operation is commutative;
- the operation is associative.
This can also be internalised in any monoidal category.

* Bimonoids
- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bimonoid

If B is a bimonoid in 𝒞, then the category Mod Mod_B of B-modules inherits a monoidal structure such that the forgetful functor Mod_B→𝒞 (the “fiber functor”) is a strong monoidal functor. For B-modules M and N, we equip the tensor product M⊗N in 𝒞 with the B-action
B⊗(M⊗N) →Δ (B⊗B)⊗(M⊗N) →≅( B⊗M)⊗(B⊗N)→M⊗N

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hopf+monoid
=bimonoid where the comonoid structure is a cogroup.

For any bimonoid H in 𝒞, the category Mod_H of H-modules inherits a monoidal structure such that the forgetful functor (“fiber functor”) Mod_H→𝒞 is strong monoidal; see bimonoid. If H is moreover a Hopf monoid and 𝒞 is a closed monoidal category, then Mod_H is also closed, and the forgetful functor is strong closed (preserves internal homs).

This is a special case of Tannaka duality for monoids/algebras, see at structure on algebras and their module categories - table.
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/structure+on+algebras+and+their+module+categories+-+table

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Frobenius+algebra
A Frobenius algebra is a vector space that is both an algebra and a coalgebra in a compatible way. This sort of compatibility is different (and more “topological”) from that involved in a bialgebra/Hopf algebra

## Module

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/module
module over a monad is called an Algebra over a monad

En fait si C est une catégorie monoidale, on peut définir une action de C
sur B comme un foncteur C*B->B respectant de bonnes propriétés; et si m est un
monoide dans C on peut considérer un module m dans B.

Si T est une monade, alors End(C) agit naturellement sur C; et un module
pour T dans C correspond exactement à une algèbre (de Cartan Eilenberg) pour la monade.

The action on a module over a monoid A in a closed monoidal category V may be equivalently encoded in terms of a V-enriched functor
ρ:BA^op→V
from the delooping one-object V-enriched category BA, corresponding to A, to V itself.
More generally it makes sense to replace BA by any V-enriched category C – regarded as the horizontal categorification of a monoid, a “monoid-oid” – and think of a V-enriched presheaf ρ:C→V as a module over the category C.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Tannaka+duality
More precisely, let V be any enriching category (a locally small closed symmetric monoidal category with all limits). Then for
    - A a monoid in V;
    - A-Mod the V-enriched category of all A-modules in V;
    - F:A-Mod→V the forgetful fiber functor ;
    A can be reconstructed as the object of enriched endomorphisms of F, given by the end
    A≃End(F):=∫ N∈A-Mod V(F(N),F(N)).
    This is just the enriched Yoneda lemma in a slight disguise.
In good cases, this end is computed already by restriction to the full subcategory AMod_dual of dualizable modules

Category of monoids
-------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+monoids
Rem: The properties of the category of monoids Mon(C), especially with respect to colimits, are markedly different according to whether or not the tensor product of C preserves colimits in each variable. (This is automatically the case if C is closed.)

Theorem 2.1. Let C be a closed symmetric monoidal category with countable coproducts which is locally presentable.
  - U:Mon(C)→C  is a finitary monadic functor.
  - If C is a λ-locally presentable category then so is Mon(C).

Free and relative free monoids:
Proposition 2.2. Let C be a monoidal category with countable coproducts that are preserved by the tensor product. Then the forgetful functor U_C has a left adjoint F_C:C→Mon(C). On an object X∈C the underlying object of F_C X is U_C F_C X=∐ n∈ℕ X^⊗n with the monoidal structure given by tensor product/juxtaposition.

Pushout of commutative monoids:
Proposition 2.4. Suppose that 𝒞 is a symmetric monoidal category, with reflexive coequalizers, that are preserved by the tensor product functors A⊗(−):𝒞→𝒞.
Then for f:A→B and g:A→C two morphisms in the category CMon(𝒞) of commutative monoids in 𝒞, the underlying object in 𝒞 of the pushout in CMon(𝒞) coincides with that of the pushout in the category AMod of A-modules:
U(B ∐_A C)≃B⊗_AC.

Pushout of noncommutative monoids:
Proposition 2.5. If C is cocomplete and its tensor product preserves colimits on both sides, then the category Mon(C) of monoids has all pushouts
along morphisms F(f):F(K)→F(L), for f:K→L a morphism in C and F:C→Mon(C) the free monoid functor from above.

Filtered colimits:
Proposition 2.6. For C a closed symmetric monoidal category the forgetful functor U:CMon(C)→C from commutative monoids to C create filtered colimits.

Structure induced from monoidal functors:
If F:C→D is a lax monoidal functor, then it induces canonically a functor between categories of monoids Mon(F):Mon(C)→Mon(D).

On Categories of Monoids, Comonoids, and Bimonoids; Hans–E. Porst

C est dite admissible si elle est monoidale symmétrique loc présentable et
le produit tensoriel est fini (ie préserve les colimites filtrantes).

2.3   Lifting  adjunctions
Si F:C->C' est un foncteur monoidal, il donne un foncteur F_Mon: Mon_C -> Mon_C', et si F a un adjoint à droite, F_Mon aussi.

2.5   Functor algebras and –coalgebras
Facts.  
1. The underlying functor Alg F→ K creates limits and those colimits which are preserved by F;  consequently,  it is monadic as soon as ithas a left adjoint.
2.  If K is cocomplete and F preserves directed colimits, then AlgF→K has a left adjoint.
3.  The underlying functor Coalg F→K creates colimits and those limits which are preserved byF;  it is comonadic as soon as it has a right adjoint.  (This is just the dual of 1. above.)
4.  If K is a locally presentable category and F preserves directed colimits, then Coalg F→K has a right adjoint.
5.  If K is locally presentable and F preserves directed colimits the categoriesAlgF and CoalgF are accessible

En particulier si T_+ est C→(C⊗C)+I et T_x est C→(C⊗C)xI; alors si C est
admissible:
1.  The category AlgT+ is finitary monadic over C and contains Mon C as a full subcategory.
2.  The category CoalgT× is comonadic over C and contains ComonC as a full subcategory.

2.6   Closure properties.
1. MonC is closed in AlgT+ with respect to the formation of limits and of directed and absolute colimits.
2. ComonC is  closed  in CoalgT× with respect to colimits and absolute limits.

Corollary: Let C be an admissible monoidal category.  Then
1. MonC is finitary monadic over C.
2. MonC is a locally λ–presentable category provided C is.

Proof: Since the Eilenberg–Moore category of a finitary monad on a locally λ–presentable category is locally λ–presentable again, 2. follows from 1. Since AlgT+ is  a  locally  finitely  presentable  category  (see  2.5)  it  follows from the previous proposition (by the reflection theorem for accessible categories [2, 2.48]) that MonC is reflective in AlgT+. Consequently, the forgetful functor MonC→C is finitary and has a left adjoint.  Monadicity of AlgT+ and closure of MonC under absolute coequalizers now proves monadicity (using the Beck–Pare–Theorem).

- cMonC is closed in MonC under limits, directed colimits and absolute colimits
- cMonC is reflective in MonC and finitary monadic over C.
- cMonC is a locally presentable category.

2.7   ComonC as  an  equifier
Proposition Let C be an admissible monoidal category.  Then
1. ComonC is a locally presentable category.
2. ComonC is comonadic over C.

- cocComonC is closed in ComonC under colimits and absolute limits
- cocComonC is coreflective in ComonC
- cocComonC is  locally  presentable and comonadic over C.

3.1 Monoidal  structures  for  monoids  and  comonoids

Fact With the monoidal structures defined above cMonC and cocComonC are symmetric monoidal categories and, moreover le produit tensoriel induit est un coproduit dans cMonC, et un produit dans cocComonC (par exemple pour cMonC via C1=C1 \tens I -> C1 \tens C2).

Proposition If C is an admissible monoidal category, then ComonC and cocComonC are  admissible.  If C is  even  monoidally  closed,  then  so  are Comon C and cocComon C,  where cocComonC is  then  in  fact  cartesian closed.
And MonC and cMonC are admissible too.
Proof: Each  functor  (C,μ,ε)⊗− on ComonC and cocComonC,  respectively,  preserves  those  colimits  which  are  preserved  by C⊗− on C, since the underlying functors of the categories of comonoids create colimits. Since these categories are locally presentable, the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem applies.

4  Bimonoids
Fact (Eckmann-Hilton Principle). The category of monoids over Mon C is isomorphic to cMonC. By duality, the category of comonoids over ComonC is isomorphic to cocComonC.

Un bimonoid est un objet C muni d'une structure de monoïde et de comonoïde
tel que les morphismes de la structure de comonoides C->C \tens C et C->I sont des morphismes de monoides ou de manière équivalente que les morphismes C \tens C->C et I->C issus de la structure de monoides sont des morphismes de comonoides.

=> MonComonC=BimonC=ComonMonC
Proposition For any admissible monoidal category C the category BimonC is locally presentable.  It is finitary monadic over ComonC and comonadic over MonC.

4.2   Commutative  and  cocommutative  bimonoids
cBimonC=ComoncMonC and cocBimonC=MoncocComonC

Proposition
1. cBimonC is a locally presentable category.  
   It is comonadic over cMonC.
   cBimonC is a reflexive subcategory of BimonC closed w.r.t.  directed colimits, and, consequently monadic over ComonC.
2. cocBimonCis  a  locally  presentable  category.
   It  is  finitary  monadic over cocComonC.
   cocBimonC is a coreflexive subcategory of BimonC and, consequently, comonadic over MonC

Facts
1.  The  cofree  bimonoid  over  a  commutative  monoid C is  commutative and, thus, the cofree commutative bimonoid over C.
2.  The free bimonoid over a cocommutative comonoid C is cocommutative and, thus, the free cocommutative bimonoid over C.

Catégories internes et groupoïdes
---------------------------------

* Catégories internes

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+category

$ Internal category

Let A be any category. A category internal to A consists of
  - an object of objects C_0∈A
  - an object of morphisms C_1∈A
together with
  - source and target morphisms s,t:C_1→C_0
  - an identity-assigning morphism e:C_0→C_1
  - a composition morphism c:C_1 ×_C_0 C_1→C_1

$ Internal groupoid
A groupoid internal to A is all of the above with a morphism C_1 →i C_1. i
joue le rôle de l'inverse.

$ Alternative definition
If A has all pullbacks, then we can form the bicategory Span(A) of spans in A. A category in A is precisely a monad in Span(A).
The underlying 1-cell is given by the span (s,t):C_0←C_1→C_0, and the pullback C_1 ×_C_0 C_1 is the vertex of the composite span (s,t)∘(s,t). The morphisms e:C_0->C_1 and c: C_1 ×_C_0 C_1→C_1 are required to be morphisms of spans, which is equivalent to imposing the source and target axioms above. Finally the unit and associativity axioms for monads imply those above.

$ Internal nerve

The notion of nerve of a small category can be generalised to give an internal nerve construction. For a small category, D, its nerve, N(D), is a simplicial set whose set of n-simplices is the set of sequences of composable morphisms of length n in D. This set can be given by a (multiple) pullback of copies of D_1. That description will carry across to give a nerve construction for an internal category:
Par Ex N(C)_3=C_1 ×_C_0 C_1 ×_C_0 C_1, the object of composable triples of arrows; ainsi N(C) est le bar construction de C.

$ In a cartesian closed category
Theorem 4.1. Let E be a finitely complete cartesian closed category. Then the category Cat(E) of internal categories in E is also finitely complete and cartesian closed.

$ In a topos

If the ambient category is a topos, then with the right kind of notion of internal functor [=j'imagine des anafunctors], the internal groupoids form the corresponding (2,1)-topos of groupoid-valued stacks and the internal categories form the corresponding 2-topos of category-valued stacks/2-sheaves.

* Torseurs

Note: si G est un groupe, alors G-Set la catégorie des ensembles muni d'une
action de G est un topos [en effet on peut voir G comme une catégorie avec
1 point, G-Set est alors la catégorie des préfaisceaux dessus]. Plus
généralement c'est vrai si G topologique et G-Set = action continue de G
dans X, X muni de la topologie discrète.

Le théorème fondamental est que G-Set est le topos classifiant des
G-torseurs, ie [E, G-Set]=G-torseurs vus dans E.
Note: E est un torseur <=> GxE->ExE est un isomorphisme.
Par exemple, si X est un espace (topologique ou frame), alors Sh(X)->BG est
équivalent à se donner une G-bundle principale sur X.

Si G est un groupe continu, on a aussi BG l'espace topologique classifiant les
G-principal bundle:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space
any G principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a
pullback of the principal bundle EG → BG.

Catégorie enrichie
------------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/enriched+category+theory

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/enriched+category
  The category K must be monoidal, so that we can define composition as a morphism ∘:hom(y,z)⊗hom(x,y)→hom(x,z).
  Pour la liste des axiomes, cf: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/enriched+category#InMonoidCat, on a par exemple for each object a∈Obj(C) a morphism j_a:I→C(a,a) – called the identity element

Note: More generally, one may think of a monoidal category as a bicategory with a single object and this way regard enrichment in a monoidal category as the special case of enrichment in a bicategory.

Note: internal categories and enriched categories are both instances of monads in bicategories (the bicategory of spans and the bicategory of matrices, respectively) and so are both forms of generalized multicategory. On the other hand, when K is an ∞-extensive category, such as Set or simplicial sets (or more generally any Grothendieck topos), (small) K-enriched categories can be identified with K-internal categories whose object-of-objects is discrete (that is, a coproduct of copies of the terminal object).

$ Enrichment through lax monoidal functors

If V is a monoidal category, then an alternative way of viewing a V-category is as a set X together with a (lax) monoidal functor Φ=Φ_d of the form
V^op →yon_V Set^V →d Set^X×X
where the codomain is identified with the monoidal category of spans on X.

$ Change of enriching category
- Passage between ordinary categories and enriched categories
Every K-enriched category C has an underlying ordinary category, usually denoted C_0, defined by C_0(x,y)=K(I,hom(x,y)) where I is the unit object of KK.

- Lax monoidal functors
More generally, any (lax) monoidal functor F:K→L between monoidal categories can be regarded as a “change of base”. By applying F to its hom-objects, any category enriched over K gives rise to one enriched over L, and this forms a 2-functor from K-Cat to L-Cat, and in fact from K-Prof to L-Prof.

Moreover, this operation is itself functorial from MonCat to 2Cat. In particular, any monoidal adjunction K⇄L gives rise to a 2-adjunction KCat⇄LCat (and also for profunctors). 
In particular, if K(I,-) has an adjoint: −⋅I:Set⇄K:K(I,−) where −⋅I:Set→K-
takes a set S to the tensor or copower S⋅I, viz. the coproduct of an
S-indexed set of copies of I, then we have an adjunction  Cat⇄KCat.

Dualité
-------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/compact+closed+category
A compact closed category, or simply a compact category, is a symmetric monoidal category in which every object is dualizable, hence a rigid symmetric monoidal category.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rigid+monoidal+category
A monoidal category is rigid if every object has duals on both sides. If only one type of dual exists, we speak of left rigid (or left autonomous) or right rigid categories.
This definition does not assert that the right dual of an object is isomorphic to its left dual: this need not be the case in general, though it is true in a braided monoidal category, and thus automatically also in a symmetric monoidal category (this last fact can be considered an algebraic form of the “Whitney trick” for knots; see this MO discussion). Note that a rigid monoidal category which is also symmetric is sometimes called compact closed, or simply “compact”.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/star-autonomous+category
it is a monoidal category in which all objects have “duals”, but in a weaker sense than in a compact closed category.

Monades
=======

Une monade est un objet en monoïde dans la catégorie des endofoncteurs. Si
on a une adjonction, on a une monade via l'endofoncteur T=GF, avec comme
unité η et comme jointure TT->T donnée par GεF.

Algèbres d'une monade
---------------------

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)
Conversely, it is interesting to consider the adjunctions which define a given monad (T,η,μ) this way. Let Adj(C,T)  be the category whose objects are the adjunctions (F,G,e,ε) such that (GF,e,GεF)=(T,η,μ) and whose arrows are the morphisms of adjunctions which are the identity on C. Then this category has
  - an initial object (FT,GT,η,μT) : C → C_T, where C_T is the Kleisli category,
    a terminal object (FT,GT,η,μT) : C → C^T, where C^T is the Eilenberg–Moore category.

An adjunction (F,G,η,ε) between two categories C is a monadic
adjunction when the category D is equivalent to the Eilenberg–Moore
category C^T for the monad T = G F.

Note: Kleisli category: Hom_C_T(X,Y)=Hom_C(X, TY) où la composition utilise
la monade: X->TY->T^2Z->Z.
C'est une catégorie équivalente à la sous-catégorie des algèbres libres.
C'est la catégorie initiale des adjonctions correspondant à la monade T,
tandis que Eilenberg-Moore et la catégorie finale.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eilenberg-Moore+category
Eilenberg–Moore category=category of T-algebra, ie (x,h) où  h:Tx->x
satisfait le diagramme T^2x->Tx. Kleisli=sub cat of free algebras, ie x=Ty, 
                        Tx -> x
h:TTy->Ty vient de la monade.

$ As a colimit completion of the Kleisli category

Proposition 3.1. Every T-algebra (A,ν) is the coequalizer of the first stage of its bar resolution:
(T^2A,μ_TA)=>(TA,μ_A)⟶(A,ν).
This is a reflexive coequalizer of T-algebras. Moreover, the underlying fork in C is a split coequalizer, hence in particular an absolute coequalizer (sometimes called the Beck coequalizer, due to its role in the Beck monadicity theorem). A splitting is given by
T^2A ⟵η_TA TA ⟵η_A A

Proposition 3.2. The T-algebras in CC are equivalently those presheaves on the category of free T-algebras whose restriction along the free functor is representable in C. In other words, the Eilenberg-Moore category C^T is the (1-category theoretic) pullback
C^T → [C_T^op,Set] 
↓       ↓[F_T^op,Set] 
C →Y  [C^op,Set]
of the category of presheaves on the Kleisli category along the Yoneda embedding Y of C.

$ Limits and colimits in EM categories

Limites: The Eilenberg-Moore category of a monad T on a category C has all limits which exist in C, and they are created by the forgetful functor.

Colimites: If C is cocomplete and C^T has reflexive coequalizers, then C^T is cocomplete. C'est le cas en particulier si T preserve reflexive coequalizers. (cf plus bas)

$ Local presentability
Definition 3.3. An accessible monad is a monad on an accessible category whose underlying functor is an accessible functor.
Proposition 3.4. The Eilenberg-Moore category of a κ-accessible monad, def. 3.3, is a κ-accessible category. If in addition the category on which the monad acts is a κ-locally presentable category then so is the EM-category.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/colimits+in+categories+of+algebras

$ Reflexive coequalizers and cocompleteness
Prop 2.1: if T preserves colimits over J, U:C^T->C reflects colimits over J.

Theorem 2.2. If C is cocomplete and C^T has reflexive coequalizers, then C^T is cocomplete.
Corollary 2.3. If T is a monad on a complete and cocomplete category C that preserves reflexive coequalizers, then C^T is complete and cocomplete.
Exemple: C is a complete, cocomplete, cartesian closed category and T is the monad corresponding to a finitary algebraic theory.
Pr: the finitary power functors x↦x^n preserve reflexive coequalizers if C is cartesian closed.

Corollary 2.4. If T is a monad on Set (resp Set/X, Vect), then Set^T is cocomplete.

$ Categories of algebras are Barr exact
Theorem 2.6. If C is a regular category or exact category in which regular epimorphisms split, and T is any monad on C, then C^T is a regular category (or exact category, respectively).
Corollary 2.7. If T is a monad on a slice category Set/X, then the category of T-algebras is (Barr-)exact

$ For functors preserving filtered colimits
Proposition 2.8. If C has coequalizers and equalizers of arbitrary sets of
parallel morphisms, and if a monad T:C→C preserves colimits of
countable chains ω→C, then C^T has coequalizers.
Corollary 2.9. If C is complete and cocomplete and T:C→C preserves filtered colimits, or even just colimits of ω, then C^T is complete and cocomplete.

$ For locally presentable categories
If C is a locally presentable category and T is an accessible monad (aka a bounded monad, aka a monad with rank) on C, then C^T is also locally presentable and in particular cocomplete.

$ Relatively free functors
Theorem 3.1. Suppose that θ:S→T is a morphism of monads on C, and suppose that C^T has coequalizers. Then the relative “forgetful” functor
C^θ:C^T→C^S (pulling back a T-algebra) to a S-algebra has a left adjoint.

Pr: C^T→C^S→C is the forgetting map on C^T, so by the adjoint lifting
theorem C^T has coequalizers of reflexive pairs, then C^θ has a left
adjoint and is, in fact, monadic.
Concretely, it sends an S-algebra Sc→c to the coequalizer
  TSc    →    Tc
      → TTC →

* cf aussi https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflexive+coequalizer
- If T is a monad on a cocomplete category C, then the category C^T of Eilenberg Moore algebras is cocomplete if and only if it has reflexive coequalizers. This is the case particularly if T preserves reflexive coequalizers.
- If F:C×D→E is a functor of two variables which preserves reflexive coequalizers in each variable separately (that is, F(c,−) and F(−,d) preserve reflexive coequalizers for all c∈C and d∈D), then F preserves reflexive coequalizers in both variables together.
- Reflexive coequalizers in Set commute with finite products
=> If T is a finitary monad on Set, then T preserves reflexive coequalizers.

* Beck's monadicity theorem gives a characterization of monadic functors.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck%27s_monadicity_theorem

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadicity+theorem

Theorem 1.2. (Beck’s monadicity theorem, tripleability theorem)
A functor U:D→C is monadic if and only if
  - U has a left adjoint, and
  - U creates coequalizers of U-split pairs
    (ie Uf, Ug: Ua => Ub a un coéq split)

Theorem 1.3. A functor U:D→C is monadic precisely if
  - U has a left adjoint,
  - U reflects isomorphisms (i.e. it is conservative), and
  - D has, and U preserves, coequalizers of U-split pairs.
[This is equivalent because a conservative functor reflects any limits or colimits which exist in its domain and which it preserves, while monadic functors are always conservative.]

L'importance des splits coéqualisers dans le cadre des monades vient de:
Let A be an algebra for the monad T on the category C, with structure map a:TA→A. Then the diagram
T^2A⇉_{μ_A}^{Ta} TA→^a A
called the canonical presentation of the algebra (A,a), is a split coequalizer in C (and a reflexive coequalizer in the category of T-algebras). The splittings are given by s=η_A:A→TA and t=η_TA:TA→T^2

Crude monadicity theorem: a functor U:D→C is monadic if
 - U has a left adjoint
 - U reflects isomorphisms
 - D has and U preserves coequalizers of reflexive pairs.

Duskin’s monadicity theorem
  - A right adjoint between finitely complete categories is monadic if it creates quotients for congruences. (on peut en fait se restreindre aux congruences whose images in C have split coequalizers).
As usual, we can also modify it by replacing reflection of limits by reflection of isomorphisms.
  - A conservative right adjoint U:D→C between finitely complete categories is monadic if any congruence in D which has a quotient in C already has a quotient in D, and that quotient that is preserved by U.

Monadicity over Set:
a functor U:D→Set is monadic if and only if
  - U has a left adjoint,
  - D admits kernel pairs and coequalizers,
  - A parallel pair R⇉S in D is a kernel pair if and only if its image under U is so, and
  - A morphism A→B in D is a regular epimorphism if and only if its image under U is so.
=> it is faithful (because it preserves equalizers and reflects isomorphisms) 

* (Effective) descent type monads
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1139403/cokleisli-category-of-the-induced-comonad-of-a-monad

Let C be a category, let T be a monad on C, let D=C^T be the category of T-algebras, let G be the induced comonad on D, and let E be the Kleisli category associated with G.
By the universal property of the Kleisli category, we have the following commutative diagram,
D ====== D
↓H       ↓U
E   -R>  C
where H:D→E is the cofree G-coalgebra functor and U:D→C is the forgetful functor.

The functor R:E→C is fully faithful. (This is a general fact about comonads
and their Kleisli categories.) Indeed, writing V:E→D for the forgetful
functor and F:C→D for the free T-algebra functor, we have
E(HA,HB)≅D(VHA,B)=D(FUA,B)≅C(UA,UB)
which is essentially how the functor R:E→C is defined in the first place.
So we deduce that E is equivalent to the full subcategory of C spanned by
the image of U:D→C.

Things are more interesting if you instead look at the category of G
-coalgebras. In that case, we get a commutative diagram of the form below,
CF -L>  D_G
↓F       ↓
D  ===== D
where the right vertical arrow is the forgetful functor. The functor L:C→D_G does not necessarily have any good properties. If L is fully faithful, then we say T is of descent type; and if L is an equivalence of categories, then we say T is of effective descent type. For an example of this, look at the case where C is the category of (left) R-modules for some ring R and T is the monad for (left) S-modules for some faithfully flat R-algebra S.

Free monad
----------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+monad
A free monad is a free object relative to a forgetful functor whose domain is a category of monads.

Ex: if C is locally presentable and we consider monads and endofunctors which are accessible. Suppose for the sake of argument that C is locally finitely presentable (the higher-ary case is analogous). Then we can restrict the above string of forgetful functors to the finitary monads, i.e. those preserving filtered colimits, to obtain: Mnd_f(C)→PtEnd_f(C)→End_f(C)→[ob(C)_f,C].
In this case, all these forgetful functors do have left adjoints, and moreover at least the functors Mnd_f(C)→End_f(C) and Mnd_f(C)→[ob(C)_f,C] are monadic.
For example, the left adjoint to Mnd_f(C)→End_f(C), shows that there exists a “free finitary monad” on any finitary endofunctor. Note, though, that this does not automatically imply that the “free finitary monad” on a finitary endofunctor is also a “free monad” on that endofunctor, i.e. that as a free object it satisfies the requisite universal property relative to all objects of Mnd(C), not merely those lying in Mnd_f(C). It is, however, generally true that this is the case: free finitary monads are also free monads.

We say that a monad T is algebraically-free on an endofunctor F if the category TAlg_mnd of T-algebras (in the sense of algebras for a monad) is equivalent to the category FAlg_{endo} of F-algebras (in the sense of algebras for an endofunctor. 

Cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebra+for+an+endofunctor: this is just a morphism F(X)→X. When C and F are well-behaved, then algebras over an endofunctor F are equivalent to algebras over a certain monad, the algebraically-free monad T generated by F. This is analogous to the relationship between an action M×B→B of a monoid M and a binary function A×B→B (an action of a set): such a function is the same thing as an action of the free monoid A^* on B.

Algebraically-free => free.
Theorem 3.2. If C is locally small and complete, then any free monad is algebraically-free.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transfinite+construction+of+free+algebras
Let 𝒜 be a locally presentable category. All endofunctors of 𝒜 which we consider will be accessible.

Definition 2.1. An endofunctor S:𝒜→𝒜 is called pointed if it is equipped with a natural transformation σ:Id_𝒜→S. It is called well-pointed if Sσ=σS (as natural transformations S→S^2).
Of course, a monad can be regarded as a pointed endofunctor where σ is its unit. Such an endofunctor is well-pointed precisely when the monad is idempotent.

Definition 2.2. If H is an endofunctor, then an H-algebra is an object A together with a map HA→A. If (S,σ) is a pointed endofunctor, then an S-algebra is an object A with a map a:SA→A such that aσ_A=1_A.

Lemma 2.3. If (S,σ) is well-pointed, then an object A admits at most one S-algebra structure. This happens exactly when σ_A is an isomorphism, in which case its inverse is that unique algebra structure.
Thus, when S is well-pointed, the category of S-algebras is a full subcategory of 𝒜.

Lemma 2.4. If (S,σ) is a well-pointed endofunctor and α:S→T is a natural transformation whose components are epimorphisms, then T is also well-pointed.
Lemma 2.5. Suppose (S_i,σ_i) is a family of (accessible) well-pointed endofunctors and let σ:Id→S be the wide pushout of all the points σ_i:Id→S_i. Then (S,σ) is (accessible and) well-pointed, and SAlg=⋂_i(S_iAlg).

Lemma 2.6. Let F:𝒜⇄ℬ:G be an adjunction and (S′,σ′) an (accessible) well-pointed endofunctor on ℬ. Let (S,σ)(S,\sigma) be the pushout
FG →Fσ′G FS′G 
↓         ↓
Id →σ     S.
Then (S,σ) is (accessible and) well-pointed, and A∈𝒜A is an S-algebra exactly when GA is an S′-algebra.

Free algebras for well-pointed endofunctors
Theorem 3.1. If 𝒜 is locally presentable and S is an accessible well-pointed endofunctor, then SAlg is reflective in 𝒜. Therefore, the algebraically-free monad on S exists (and is accessible).

Example 3.2. Let K be a set of morphisms in 𝒜; recall that an object A∈𝒜 is said to be orthogonal to K if 𝒜(k,A) is a bijection for all k∈K, which is to say that each functor 𝒜(k,−):𝒜→Set^2 takes A to an isomorphism, where Set^2 is the arrow category of Set. Now the subcategory of isomorphisms is reflective in Set^2, hence is the algebras for a well-pointed endofunctor R_k. By Lemma 2.6, there is a well-pointed endofunctor S_k on 𝒜 whose algebras are the objects orthogonal to k. And by Lemma 2.5, there is a well-pointed endofunctor S whose algebras are those objects orthogonal to all k∈K. Thus, by Theorem 3.1, the category of objects orthogonal to K is reflective in 𝒜.
Example 3.3. Applying the previous example on slice categories, we can construct orthogonal factorization systems.

4. Free algebras for pointed endofunctors
Now let (T,τ)(T,\tau) be a general (accessible) pointed endofunctor.
If α:T′→T is a natural transformation, we have an adjunction α_!:T′/𝒜⇄T/𝒜:α^* in which α sends (A,B,a) to (A,B,a∘α A) and α_! is defined by a pushout.
Note that if α is τ:Id→T, then τ^*(A,B,a) is the composite A →τ_A TA →a BA.

Lemma 4.1. The category TAlg of T-algebras is a reflective full subcategory of T/𝒜.
Proof. It is easy to show that it is a full subcategory. Moreover, (A,B,a) lies in TAlg just when τ^*(A,B,a) is an isomorphism. The isomorphisms are a reflective subcategory of 𝒜^2, hence the algebras for a well-pointed endofunctor R. Now by Lemma 2.6, there is a well-pointed endofunctor S of T/𝒜 whose algebras are precisely the T-algebras. Now apply Theorem 3.1.  ▮

Theorem 4.2. The category TAlg is monadic over 𝒜, and cocomplete. In particular, the algebraically-free monad on T exists and is accessible.

The free functor can be defined inductively a transfinite sequence
       TX_0 → TX_1 → TX_2 → … 
       ↓ x_0  ↓ x_1  ↓ x_2 
X_0 →  X_1 →  X_2 →  X_3 →  …
such that X_β→X_β+1 is equal to x_β∘τ_{X_β}

Ex 4.3: The algebraic small object argument is an enhancement of the small object argument, based on a free monad construction, that produces algebraic weak factorization systems.

5. Free algebras for unpointed endofunctors

An algebra for an unpointed endofunctor H is the same as an algebra for the pointed endofunctor T≔Id+HT. Thus, Theorem 4.2 can be applied to unpointed endofunctors as well.
In this case, the transfinite sequence for the free H-algebra on A∈𝒜A is much simpler: we have X_0=A and X_β+1=A+HX_β.

6. Colimits of algebras for a monad

Let T be a monad on 𝒜, and let TAlg denote the category of T-algebras qua monad.
Theorem 6.1. The category TAlg is a reflective subcategory of T/𝒜.

Corollary 6.2. TAlg is locally presentable. Moreover, any functor TAlg→T′Alg induced by a monad morphism T′→T has a left adjoint.

7. Colimits of monads

When speaking of colimits of monads, we are not interested merely in colimits in the category of monads, but algebraic colimits in the following sense. Let V:K→Monad(𝒜) be a diagram in the category of monads on 𝒜, and define a V-algebra to be an object A together with V_k-algebra structures which commute with the images of morphisms in K.
Definition 7.1. An algebraic colimit of V is a monad P whose usual Eilenberg-Moore category PAlg is equivalent, over 𝒜, to the category of V-algebras.
It follows, by arguments similar to those for algebraically-free monads, that an algebraic colimit is also a colimit in the category of monads.

Theorem 7.2. Algebraic colimits of (accessible) monads exist (and are accessible).

Theorem (Fakir). Let C be a complete, well-powered category, and let M:C→C be a monad with unit u:1→M and multiplication m:MM→M. Then there is a universal idempotent monad, giving a right adjoint to IdempotentMonad(C)↪Monad(C)

Proof. Given a monad M, define a functor M′ as the equalizer MuM u and uMu M:
M′↪M=>MM. This M′ acquires a monad structure. It might not be an idempotent monad (although it will be if M is left exact). However we can apply the process again, and continue transfinitely.

Distributive laws
-----------------

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/distributive+law
Exemple: pour combiner la monade Ab groupe abélien et la monade Mon monoïde
pour faire la monade Ring anneau libre, il faut Mon Ab Mon Ab -> Mon Ab.
En utilisant que Mon et Ab sont des monades, on veut donc Ab Mon -> Mon Ab.

Monads in any 2-category C make themselves a 2-category Mnd in which 1-cells are either lax or colax morphisms of monads; by dualization the same is true for comonads. Monads internal to the 2-category of monads are called distributive laws. In particular, distributive laws themselves make a 2-category. There are other variants like distributive laws between a monad and an endofunctor, “mixed” distributive laws between a monad and a comonad...

Distributive laws from the monad T to the endofunctor P are in a canonical bijection with lifts of P to an endofunctor P^T in the Eilenberg-Moore category A^T, satisfying U^TP^T=PU^T. [Note: Si P est une monade, on demande les conditions de compatibilité supplémentaires qui vont bien]

Exemples:
- Ab and Mon qui donnent Ring
- In a distributive category products distribute over coproducts.
- For many standard choices of tensor products in the presence of direct sums the former distribute over the latter.
- strict factorization systems can be identified with distributive laws between categories regarded as monads in Span(Set).
  More generally, factorization systems over a subcategory can be identified with distributive laws in Prof. Ordinary orthogonal factorization systems are a special case.

Monades et Objets en Monoïdes
-----------------------------

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/enriched+category
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category

A 2-category is a category enriched over the cartesian monoidal category Cat

Monade:
1) On peut définir une monade dans une bicatégorie K comme un objet a, un
endomorphisme t:a->a, une unité 1_a=>t, et une 2-multiplication \mu: t o t -> t
2) Une monade dans CAT (vue comme 2-catégorie) est une monade au sens usuel
(ie un objet en monoïde dans Hom(C,C) ie dans les endofoncteurs)

Monade => objet en monoïde
- Une catégorie monoïdale est un objet en monoïde dans CAT
- Une catégorie monoïdale C = Une 2-catégorie BC avec un seul 0-objet
  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category
  -> horizontal composition in BC is the tensor product in C and vertical
  composition in BC is composition in C.
- Un objet en monoïde dans C = Une monade dans BC

On a donc:
- Niveau 0: Set (la catégorie des 0-objets). Un 0-objet (ie un ensemble A)
  peut être muni d'une structure de monoïde
  Un monoïde est simplement une catégorie avec un objet.
- Niveau 1: Catégories. Une catégorie C est telle que Hom(A,A) est une
  0-catégorie qui est un monoïde; réciproquement un monoïde est une
  catégorie avec 1 objet.
  On a une notion de catégorie monoïdale (= vertical enhancement of monoid)
  et d'objet en monoïde dans une telle catégorie.
- Niveau 2:
  Si C est monoïdale, on peut définir des C-catégories, Hom(A,A) est alors
  un objet en monoïde dans C. Réciproquement, un objet en monoïde dans C
  est une C-Catégorie avec un seul objet.
  Cat est monoïdale, donc on peut définir 2-Catégorie=Cat-Catégorie.
  Ainsi une 2-catégorie C est telle que Hom(A,A) est une 1-catégorie
  monoïdale, réciproquement si C est monoïdale, la catégorie BC avec 1
  objet est une 2-catégorie.
  Une monade est un objet en monoïde dans Hom(A,A); réciproquement un objet
  en monoïde dans C est une monade dans BC. Souvent on applique ça à la
  2-Catégorie 2-Cat: une monade est alors un objet en monoïde dans les
  endofoncteurs

Donc on peut descendre: un monoïde est une catégorie avec un objet, une
catégorie monoïdale est une 2-catégorie avec un objet;
étendre horizontalement: une catégorie c'est un monoïdeoïde, ie une collection de monoïdes; une 2-catégorie c'est une collection de 1-catégorie monoïdales;
internaliser: un objet en monoïde c'est un monoïde vu dans une catégorie monoïdale;
monter: Set est une catégorie, Cat est une 2-catégorie; Catégorie monoïdale:
généralisation à Cat d'un monoïde, ie objet en monoïde dans Cat; monade:
généralisation à 2-Cat.

En résumé: on part de Set, dans lequel on peut définir les monoïdes, on remarque que Hom(X,X) est un monoïde; on horizontalifie les monoïdes pour obtenir Cat dans laquelle on peut définir les catégories monoïdales et les objets en monoïdes dedans, on remarque que Hom(C,C) est une catégorie monoïdale (et un object en monoïde dedans est une monade); on horizontalifie les catégories monoïdale pour avoir les 2-catégories, et une monade est un objet en monoïde dans la catégorie monoïdale Hom(CC, CC), CC un objet de la 2-catégorie. Réciproquement, si C est monoïdale elle forme une 2-catégorie BC (avec un unique objet C), un objet en monoïde dans C est une monade dans BC; si M est un monoïde et il forme une catégorie BM avec un unique objet.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/actegory
As monoidal categories are a vertical categorification of monoids, actegories are a vertical categorification of actions of a monoid. So given a monoidal category (C,⊗,I,l,r,a) an actegory is another category D with a notion of “tensor by object of C”, i.e., a functor: ⊘:C×D→D that is associative and unital up to natural isomorphism with respect to ⊗ in ways that generalize actions of a monoid, and satisfy coherence laws similar to those of a monoidal category.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PROP
   ‘PROP’ — an abbreviation of ‘products and permutations category’ — is a symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, used to describe a given sort of algebraic structure. One can think of PROPs as a variant of Lawvere theories suitable for noncartesian contexts. In this respect they are similar to operads. However, they are more general, because they can be used to describe operations with many outputs as well as many inputs.

Definition 2.1. A PROP is a strict symmetric monoidal category where every object is of the form x^⊗n=x⊗x⊗⋯⊗x for a single object x and n≥0.

Théories algébriques
====================

## Théorie algébrique.

### Variété équationelle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra)

Birkhoff: A class of algebraic structures of the same signature is a variety if and only if it is closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and arbitrary products

If V is a finitary algebraic category (i.e. the category of a variety of algebras, with homomorphisms as morphisms) then the forgetful functor
    G : V → Set
has a left adjoint F : Set → V, namely the functor that assigns to each set the free algebra on that set. This adjunction is strictly monadic, in that the category V is isomorphic to the Eilenberg–Moore category Set T  for the monad T = G F.

One says a category is an algebraic category if it is monadic over Set. This is a more general notion than "finitary algebraic category".

Note: pour une preuve que qu'une catégorie algébrique est équivalente à
la catégorie d'algèbre de la monade associé à foncteur d'oubli o foncteur
libre sur Set, cf par exemple
http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2012/REUPapers/Sankar.pdf
MONADS  AND  ALGEBRAIC  STRUCTURES

### Théorie algébrique finie

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere+theory
Definition. 
- A Lawvere theory or finite-product theory is (equivalently encoded by its syntactic category which is) a category T with finite products in which every object is isomorphic to a finite cartesian power x^n = x of a distinguished object x (called the generic object for the theory T).
- A homomorphism of such theories T→T′ is a product-preserving functor.

Remark. For T a Lawvere theory, we are to think of the hom-set T(n,1):=T(x n,x)T(n,1) := T(x^n, x) as the set of n-ary operations definable in the theory.

Definition. A model of T – an algebra over the Lawvere theory or simply T-algebra – is a product-preserving functor A:T→Set and homomorphism of T-algebras is a natural transformation between such functors.

Lien avec une théorie algébrique:
 - The Lawvere theory T is the category opposite to the category of free algebras on finitely many generators,
 - The category of algebras is in turn equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors T→Set
 - The (finite) free algebras are retrieved as the representable functors T→Set

As discussed in the article on operads, the notion of Lawvere theory may also be formulated in terms of operads relative to the theory of cartesian monoidal categories.

Caractérisation:
Theorem 3.1. A concrete category U:C→Set is a category of algebras over a Lawvere theory precisely if U
  - is monadic
  - is finitary in that it preserves filtered colimits.

Theorem 3.2. (Birkhoff's HSP theorem)
Suppose given a language L generated by a set of (single-sorted) finitary operations, and a class C of structures for L. Then C is the class of models for a set of universally quantified equations between terms of L if and only if
    (H) The class is closed under homomorphic images,
    (S) The class is closed under subalgebras,
    (P) The class is closed under taking products.

Si A est une algèbre, une congruence est une relation d'équivalence R
stable par les opérations de A. A/R est alors une algèbre.
Si f,g: A->B, le coéqualisateur est A/<f(a)=g(a)>

Exemple: pour une théorie vide, on a T=FiniteSet^op, que l'on note S. Une
algèbre est juste un ensemble.
Si T est une théorie, on a un toujours un morphisme de théorie S->T, 1
\mapsto x qui est essentiellement surjectif.

Soit f:T_1 -> T_2 un morphisme de théorie, le pullback f^* donne un
morphisme T_2-Alg -> T_1-Alg. Ce foncteur a un adjoint à gauche f_*:
T_1-Alg->T_2-Alg.

Preuve: si K_1 et K_2 sont les monades associés, si A est une T_1-algèbre
on peut définir f_*A comme le coéqualisateur K2K1 A => K2A -> f_*A
qui en fait donc une T_2-algèbre.

Exemple: si i:S->T, alors on a le foncteur algèbre libre i_*: Set -> T-Alg,
adjoint au foncteur i^*: T-Alg -> Set qui est simplement le foncteur
d'oubli (via l'identification de Set à S-Alg).
Par exemple i_*([n]) est l'algèbre libre à n éléments, donné comme le
foncteur représentable Hom(x^n, .): T->Set. Pour un ensemble S quelconque,
Free(S) est la colimite filtrante des Free(S_n) pour S_n \subset S fini.
Pour l'adjonction précédente, on écrit A=Free_T1(A)/Gamma et on pose
f_*(A)=Free_T2(A)/<Gamma>

Limits and colimits of T-algebras
Proposition. For T a Lawvere theory, the category TAlg has all small limits and colimits. The limits and the filtered colimits in TAlg are computed pointwise.

Liens avec les monades: l'adjonction i_*, i^* donne une monade sur S-Alg=Set.
Réciproquement, si on a une monade T sur Set, alors
The large Lawvere theory Th(T) of T is the opposite of the Kleisli category, Kl(T)^op.
Théorème:
- The monad associated with the theory Th(T) is isomorphic to T
- the Lawvere theory of the monad of C is equivalent to C.
- Each algebra X of the monad T gives rise to a model M_X of the Lawvere theory
  Kl(T)^op↪Alg(T)^op→hom(−,X)Set
  On a une équivalence de catégorie: M:Alg(T)→Mod(Th(T),Set)


## Théorie algébrique généralisée

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+theory
Definition:. A Lawvere theory or algebraic theory is a locally small category C with small products that is equipped with an object x such that the (unique-up-to-isomorphism) product-preserving functor
i:Set^op→C:[1]↦x is essentially surjective.

Multi-sorted theories: Π:(Set/S)^op→C is product preserving and essentially surjective.
Note: Each object U→S of Set/S may be thought of as a monomial term ∏_s x_s^U_s indexed by S, ie (Set/S)^{op} is the free category with small products generated by the set S.
If D has small products, a model of C in D is a product-preserving functor M:C→D. A homomorphism of models is simply a natural tranformation between product-preserving functors

Commutative theories: Commutative algebraic theories are (single-sorted) algebraic theories for which each operation is an algebra homomorphism. These form an important subclass. Their categories of models are closed: the hom sets have a natural model-structure (algebra-structure), and the enriched Hom-functor has a left adjoint, tensor product.

- Lien avec les monades pour le cas multisorted (locally small): 
Π:(Set/S)^op→C

Remark: Modèles(Set/S^op)=Prod((Set/S)^op,Set)≃^−∘i Set^S≃Set/S
ie Set/S^op is the theory of S-multi sorted set.

Theorem 1. The functor
Set/S →Π^op C^op→y Mod(C,Set) is left adjoint to the functor
Prod(C,Set) →^Prod(Π,Set) Prod((Set/S)^op,Set)≃Set/S
Note: y:C^op→Mod(C,Set), c->hom(c,-) is the (co)yoneda embedding, y(c) is
product preserving.

De même si T:Set/S est une monade, la théorie de Lawrere large Th(T) est
l'opposé de la catégorie de Kleisli est bien une théorie:
the left adjoint Set/S→Kl(T) is coproduct-preserving, so we have a product-preserving functor (Set/S)^op→Kl(T)^op.
Th 2: The monad associated with the theory Th(T) is isomorphic to T;
Th 3: Réciproquement let C be an S-sorted Lawvere theory. Then the Lawvere theory of the monad of C is equivalent to C.

- Algebras and models
Each algebra XX of the monad T gives rise to a model M_X of the Lawvere theory:
Kl(T)^op ↪ Alg(T)^op →^hom(−,X) Set
so we have a functor M:Alg(T)→Mod(Th(T),Set).
This functor is an equivalence.
It is convenient to proceed as follows. By Theorem 2, the underlying functor
Prod(Kl(T)^op,Set)→Set/S has a left adjoint such that the associated monad is T, and this yields a comparison functor
A:Prod(Kl(T)^op,Set)→Alg(T), which is the essential inverse of M.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/essentially+algebraic+theory
An essentially algebraic theory or finite limits theory is a category that is finitely complete, i.e., has all finite limits. A model of an essentially algebraic theory T is a functor F:T→Set that is left exact, i.e., preserves all finite limits. A homomorphism of models is a natural transformation.

Categories of models of finitary essentially algebraic theories are precisely equivalent to locally finitely presentable categories. These are equivalent to categories of models of finite limit sketches.

Examples: A (multisorted) Lawvere theory T is the same thing (has the same models) as a finitary essentially algebraic theory in which all operations are total. If C_T is the opposite of the category of finitely presented T-algebras, then the category of models is equivalent to Lex(C_T,Set).

An equivalent formulation is as a cartesian theory, a geometric theory in which disjunction ⋁ is not used, and each use of existential quantification ∃ must be accompanied by a proof that existence is unique.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+algebraic+theory
Cartmell’s paper explains how, for every GAT there is an EAT with the same models and for every EAT there is a GAT with the same models. In this sense they are more or less equivalent in descriptive power.

Catégories finiment localement présentables
-------------------------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sketch
Definition 2.1. A sketch is a small category T equipped with a set L of cones and a set C of cocones. A realized sketch is one where all the cones in L are limit cones and all the cocones in C are colimit cocones.
A model of a sketch in a category 𝒞 is a functor T→𝒞 taking each cone in L to a limit cone and each cocone in C to a colimit cocone.

A Lawvere theory is a special case of a (limit-)sketch

An accessible category is equivalently:
  - a full subcategory of a presheaf category that’s closed under κ-filtered colimits for some κ
  - the category of models of a sketch

A locally presentable category is equivalently:
  - a reflective full subcategory of a presheaf category that’s closed under κ-filtered colimits for some κ
  - the category of models of a limit sketch
  - an accessible category with all small limits
  - an accessible category with all small colimits

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+finitely+presentable+category
=ℵ_0-locally presentable category.
A category C satisfying (any of) the following equivalent conditions is said to be locally finitely presentable (or lfp):
  - C has all small colimits, the category C_fp is essentially small, and any object in C is a filtered colimit of the canonical diagram of finitely presentable objects mapping into it.
  - C is the category of models for an essentially algebraic theory. Here an ‘essentially algebraic theory’ is a small category D with finite limits, and its category of ‘models’ is the category of finite-limit-preserving functors D→Set
  - C is the category of models for a finite limit sketch.
  - C_fp has finite colimits, and the restricted Yoneda embedding C↪[C_fp^op,Set] identifies C with the category of finite-limit-preserving functors C_fp^op→Set.

* https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~maru/documents/locally_finitely_presentable_cats.pdf
Recapitulating, a locally small, cocomplete category is locally finitely presentable if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
1. C_fp is  skeletally  small,  and  any  object  in C is  the  filtered  colimit  of  a diagram in C_fp
2.  There  exists  a  set S of  objects  of C_fp such  that  any  object  in C is  the filtered colimit of a diagram with objects in S.
3. C_fp is  skeletally  small,  and  the  functor F : C → [C_fp,Set] defined  by F(X)(A) = Hom(A,X) is fully faithful.
4. C_fp is  skeletally  small,  and  the  functor F : C → [C_fp,Set] defined  by F(X)(A) = Hom(A,X) is faithful and conservative.
5.  There exists a small subcategory S ⊂ C_fp such that the functor F : C → [S,Set] defined by F(X)(A) = Hom(A,X) is faithful and conservative.
6. C is the category of algebras for a finitary essentially algebraic theory.
If, in addition, C has equalizers, the adjective “faithful” can be dropped from
conditions 4 and 5.

Rem: in the category of algebras for any algebraic theory, the categorical
and algebraic notions of finite presentability agree.

Proposition 15. An object X in C can be written as a filtered colimit of objects in C_fp if and only if X is the colimit of the canonical diagram U_X : C_fp ↓ X →C , where U_X is the forgetful functor.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gabriel-Ulmer+duality
Gabriel–Ulmer duality says that there is an equivalence of 2-categories (or in other words, a biequivalence)
Lex^op → LFP, C ↦ Lex(C,Set)
where Lex is the 2-category of:
  - small finitely complete categories,
  - finite limit preserving functors, and
  - natural transformations,
and LFP is the 2-category of
  - locally finitely presentable categories,
  - finitary right adjoint functors and
  - natural transformations.

The idea is that an object C∈Lex can be thought of as an essentially algebraic theory, which has a category of models Lex(C,Set). Gabriel–Ulmer duality says that this category of models is locally finitely presentable, all LFP categories arise in this way, and we can recover the theory C from its category of models.

Locally presentable category
----------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+presentable+category
A locally presentable category is a category which contains a small set S of small objects such that every object is a nice colimit over objects in this set.
This says equivalently that a presentable category C is a reflective localization C↪PSh(S)of a category of presheaves over S. Since here PSh(S) is the free colimit completion of S and the localization imposes relations, this is a presentation of C by generators and relations, hence the name (locally) presentable category.

A category 𝒞 is called locally presentable if
  - it is an accessible category;
  - it has all small colimits (or all small limits, cf Borceux vol 2 Théorème 5.5.8)
En déroulant tout:
  - 𝒞 is a locally small category;
  - 𝒞 has all small colimits;
  - there exists a small set S↪Obj(𝒞) of λ-small objects that generates 𝒞 under λ-filtered colimits, for some regular cardinal λ. 
[Attention, a κ-small colimit of κ-compact objects is again a κ-compact object, mais une λ-filtered colimit peut être de taille > λ]

=> C is cocomplete, complete, wellpowered, co-wellpowered, C a (regular
épi, mono) factorisation, les λ-directed colimits sont exactes, any
cocontinuous functor C->D a un adjoint à gauche.

[- wellpowered: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/253927/a-category-with-a-strong-generator-is-well-powered
Johnstone [Sketches of an elephant, Remark A1.4.17] only mentions that a locally small category with finite intersections of subobjects and a (strong) generating set is well-powered.
- complete: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/45577/any-cocomplete-category-with-a-dense-small-full-subcategory-is-complete
if C is a cocomplete category endowed with a small full subcategory B with the property that every element in C is a colimit of elements in B (hum je pense qu'il faut que ce soit la colimite canonique B/c, ie B dense), then C is complete. En effet, ça implique même C totale, cf #total categorie plus haut.]


* Borceux Déf 5.2.1: C est loc. présentable ssi C est cocomplète, et a un
ensemble (G_i) de strong generators λ-présentables.

Th: soit G la catégorie engendrée par les générateurs G_i∈S sous les
λ-colimits. Alors G est skeletally small, est exactement
la sous-catégorie des objets λ-présentables, et a les λ-colimites calculées
comme dans C. G est dense, et G/x est λ-filtrée pour tout x∈C, et tout
x∈C est small.
C est équivalente à λ-Lex(G^op, Set) [où plutôt à λ-Lex(T, Set) une small catégorie T λ-complète équivalente à G^op]
Donc les λ-limites commutent avec les λ-filtered colimites, qui sont
universelles.
Réciproquement, si T a les λ-limits, C=λ-Lex(T, Set) est loc. présentable.
et les objets λ-présentables/small sont exactement les foncteurs
représentables.
[En effet, Lex(C,Set) est cocomplet, et les représentables sont exacts à
gauche, denses donc strongly generator, et préservent les colimites
filtrées.]

- Locally presentable categories are precisely the accessibly embedded full reflective subcategories of categories of presheaves on some category K.
=> Proposition 4.10. Every sheaf(=Grothendieck) topos is locally presentable.

- Locally presentable categories are precisely the categories of models of limit-sketches (ou cf Borceux modèles of colimit-sketches):
Cf Gabriel–Ulmer: there is an equivalence of 2-categories Lex^op ≃ LFP
(locally finitely presented), C↦Lex(C,Set) which sends a finitely complete
category C to the category of models of C, i.e., the category of left exact
functors C→Set.

Stabilité:
Props: Lemma 3.8. A slice category of a locally presentable category is again locally presentable.

Theorem 3.9. If A is locally presentable/accessible and C is a small category, then the functor category A^C is locally presentable/accessible.

Theorem 4.12. If T is an accessible monad (a monad whose underlying functor is an accessible functor) on a locally presentable category A, then the category A^T of algebras over the monad is locally presentable.
In particular, if A is locally presentable and i:B→A is a reflective subcategory, then B is locally presentable if i is accessible.

Details sur locally λ-presentable => locally μ-presentable for μ⊳λ
- If λ≤μ, then every λ-presentable object is μ-presentable, and any μ-small colimit of μ-presentable objects is again μ-presentable. In particular,any μ-small colimit (λ-filtered or not) of λ-presentable objects is μ-presentable.
- If 𝒞 is locally λ-presentable and μ is a regular cardinal with μ≥λ, then every μ-presentable object of 𝒞 can be written as a μ-small (not necessarily λ-filtered) colimit of λ-presentable objects (Remark 1.30 in AR).
- If 𝒞 is λ-accessible and μ is a regular cardinal with μ⊳λ (a “sharp” cardinal inequality — see below), then every μ-presentable object of 𝒞 can be written as a μ-small λ-filtered colimit of λ-presentable objects (Remark 2.15 in AR).
- If F is an accessible functor, then there is a regular cardinal κ such that F preserves μ-presentable objects for any regular cardinal μ with μ⊳κ.

Theorem 2.7. The weak VP is equivalent to the statement:

Accessible category
-------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/accessible+category
Definition 2.1. A locally small category C is κ-accessible for a regular cardinal κ if:
  - the category has κ-directed colimits (or, equivalently, κ-filtered colimits), and
  - there is a set of κ-compact objects G_i that generate the category under κ-directed/filtered colimits.
Then C is an accessible category if there exists a κ so that it is κ-accessible.

Borceux Def 5.3.1: Si C est κ-accessible, G (la catégorie générée par les
G_i) est dense dans C, et G/x est κ-filtered pour tout objet x (et comme G
est dense, x est la colimite de G/x, donc en particulier est small car G/x
est small). De plus la sous-catégorie de C des objets κ-small
(=présentables) est petite; un tel objet s'écrit comme un équalisateur g=>g
pour un g dans G, cf Prop 5.3.8.

Proposition 2.3. Equivalent characterizations include that C is accessible iff:
  - it is the category of models (in Set, or even in a locally presentable
    category) of some small sketch.
  - it is of the form Ind_κ(S) for S small, i.e. the κ-ind-completion of a small category, for some κ.
  - it is of the form κ-Flat(S) for S small and some κ, i.e. the category of κ-flat functors from some small category to Set.
  - it is the category of models (in Set) of a suitable type of logical theory.
    =essentially algebraic theory
Note, cf Borceux: on peut prendre pour S la catégorie duale de G, qui est
équivalente à une petite catégorie. Pour le sketch on peut prendre le
sketch donné par la catégorie GG de tous les objets κ-small, C est
équivalente aux foncteurs [[GG, Set], Set] qui préservent les κ-limites et les
petites colimites. Sauf que le sketch [GG, Set] est large, donc il faut
travailler un peu pour montrer qu'il y a un petit sketch qui a les mêmes
modèles dans Set. De plus ce sketch a déjà les limites/colimites de ses
cones/cocones, ce qui montre que les modèles d'un sketch sont toujours
équivalent aux modèles d'un autre sketch qui a ses limites/colimites
marqués par ses cones/cocones.

Proposition 3.2. (preservation of accessibility under inverse images)
Let F:C→D be a functor between locally presentable categories which preserves κ-filtered colimits, and let D_0⊂D be an accessible subcategory. Then the inverse image f^−1(D_0)⊂C is a κ-accessible subcategory.

Proposition 3.7. A small category is accessible precisely when it is idempotent complete.

### Modèles d'une théorie géométrique de type preheaf:

cf la discussion dans https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/04/on_a_topological_topos.html:
- if 𝒞 is a κ-accessible category, then 𝒞 is the free completion of the full subcategory of κ-presentable objects under κ-filtered colimits. Conversely, the free completion of any small category under κ-filtered colimits is κ-accessible.

- The classifying topos B[𝕋] of a geometric theory 𝕋 is a presheaf category (the theory is “of presheaf type”) if and only if the category Mod(𝕋) of models in Set is finitely accessible; cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/theory+of+presheaf+type

  Attention: l'énoncé est faux tel quel, le vrai énoncé est Mod(T) est
  finiment accessible ssi il existe T' de type presheaf tel que
  Mod(T)=Mod(T'). Exemple: la théorie cohérente T des corps est
  ℵ_0-accessible, donc vient aussi d'une théorie T' de type presheaf, mais
  T n'est pas de type presheaf: there exists no coherent presheaf type
  axiomatization of field.

[Preuve: par Diaconescu, si T est un presheaf [C,S], les modèles Top/S(E, [C,S]) =~ Flat(C,E).
Avec les résultats sur les catégories accessibles, on en déduit l'énoncé.]

THEORIES OF PRESHEAF TYPE, TIBOR BEKE

I Presheaf topos

Def: T is of presheaf type if its classifying topos B[T] is (equivalent to) a presheaf topos.

Proposition 0.1.
For a category M, the following properties are equivalent:
(i) M is a finitely accessible category in the sense of Makkai–Pare [14], i.e., it has filtered colimits and a small dense subcategory C of finitely presentable objects
(ii) M is equivalent to Pts(Set, C), the category of points of some presheaf topos
(iii) M is equivalent to the free filtered cocompletion (also known as Ind-C) ofa small category C.
(iv) M is equivalent to Mod(T) for some geometric theory of presheaf type.
Moreover, if these are satisfied for a given M , then the C —in any of (i), (ii) and (iii)— can be taken to be the full subcategory of M consisting of finitely presentable objects. (There may be inequivalent choices of C , as it is in general only determined up to idempotent completion).

Preuve: (ii)⇒(iii)⇒(iv)⇒(ii) is provided by Mac Lane-Moerdijk Theorem 2 [bis] on p. 382 since Flat(𝒞) is the free filtered cocompletion of C and also obviously a category of models for the geometric theory of flat functors C→Set. And then (i)⇔(ii) follows from the Representation Theorem 2.26 of Adámek and Rosický.

Warning: in (iv) the presheaf topos one recovers this way (which indeed has M as its category of Set-models) need not coincide with the sought-for topos B[T].

Theorem 1.1. si T est de presheaf type, et T+ une extension géométrique de
T dans le même language, alors T+ est de presheaf type si
  - T+ a assez de modèles dans Set
  - tout modèle de T+ dans Set est vu dans Mod(T) comme filtered colimits
    de modèles de T+ finiment présentables dans Mod(T).

II Coherent presheaf topos

Theorem 2.1.
Let C be a small category. The following are equivalent:
(i) Pre(C) is a coherent topos.
(ii) C has all fc finite limits. (That is, any functor F:D→C with D a finite diagram has an fc limit in C.) [fc= finite cone terminal = il y a un ensemble fini TT tel que tout X a une map, pas forcément unique, X->T, T \in TT]
(iii) C has fc terminal objects, fc products, and fc equalizers.

Corollaire: il n'y a pas d'axiomatisation des corps cohérente de type
presheaf (ie on peut avoir l'un ou l'autre, mais pas les deux en même
temps).
Pr: If there were, its classifying topos would have to be
Set^F,where F is spanned by fields that are finitely presentable as objects of the category of fields and homomorphisms. But Set^F is not a coherent topos, since F has infinitely many components —to wit, each of the prime fields F_p
as well as the rationals Q are finitely presentable as objects
of fields(!), and no two of them are connected by a zig-zag o fhomomorphisms—
where as for a coherent Set^F, F has to have fc initial objects, a fortiori a finite number of connected components.

As an immediate consequence of Prop.0.1 and Thm.2.1:
Corollary 2.6.
For a category M, the following properties are equivalent:
(i) M is a finitely accessible category some (equivalently, all) of whose dense sub- categories consisting of finitely presentable objects possess fc
finite colimits
(ii) M is equivalent to Pts(Set, C), i.e., the free filtered cocompletion of a small category C that has all fc finite colimits
(iii) M is equivalent to Mod(T) for *some* coherent theory of presheaf type.
Moreover, if these are satisfied for a given M , then the C in (ii) can be taken to be the full subcategory of M consisting of finitely presentable objects, and the theory T of (iii) can be taken to be that of coherent flat functors.

Attention dans (iii) au *some*: One should mention that for a coherent theory T (even with just one axiom) Mod(T) may fail to be finitely accessible (see Remark 2.59 of Adamek–Rosicky),though it will always be א1-accessible.

III Axiomatizing ind-objects
Theorem 2.8. Let K be a locally finitely presentable category, and G a full
subcategory of K such that objects of G are finitely presentable in K. Let
A be the closure of G in K under filtered colimits, i.e., the full
subcategory of K with all objects that can be written as colimits of a
filtered diagram in G. Then A is a finitely accessible category, equivalent
to Ind-G. 
Assume moreover K=Mod(T), where T is a finite limit theory.
Then there exists, in the language of T, a geometric theory T+ of presheaf
type such that A=Mod(T+). If G has fc finite colimits, then T+ can be
chosen coherent.

IV Exemples: des théories où le Th 1.1 s'applique pour montrer qu'elles
sont de presheaf type
- Negated positive sentence
- Non empty domains
- Universal relational theories
  - Cosimplicial sets
  - Simplicial sets
  - Preserving and reflecting formulas
- Flat modules
- Hereditary module properties over noetherian ring

Résumé:
- dans une catégorie monoïdale symmétrique 'admissible' 
  [voir 'categories of monoids'] (C,x) on peut voir un objet en
  monoïde comme une algèbre pour la monade monoïde libre (A->\sum A^n) [C
  étant admissible, elle a les coproduits dénombrables].
- la catégorie Mon_C des monoïdes reste monoïdale symmétrique; un objet en
  monoïde dedans est un monoïde commutatif.
  Note: il faut que x soit symmétrique pour que AxB reste un objet en
  monoïde si A et B le sont.
- la catégorie cMon_C des monoïdes commutatifs est monoïdale symmétrique
  (et les foncteurs cMon_C -> Mon_C et cMon_C -> C sont monadiques);
  le produit tensoriel est alors un produit cartésien.
- Si M est un objet en monoïde, on a la catégorie des modules (à gauche ou
  à droite) sous M, qui est monadique via le foncteur module libre: X->M x X
- Si M est un monoïde commutatif, on a un produit tensoriel sur les
  M-modules comme le coéqualisateur de AxMxB⇉AxB.
  M-Mod est alors monoïdale symmétrique.
  Note: on a besoin que M soit commutatif pour que Ax_M B soit un M-module.
- on peut regarder les bimorphismes dans cMon_c (ie les morphismes AxB->C
  bilinéaires, c'est à dire les morphismes induits A->AxB->C et B->AxB->C
  via l'unité sont linéaires); on obtient un produit
  tensoriel ⊗, défini (dans le cadre d'une monade monoïdale) par le
  coéqualisateur T(TAxTB)=>T(AxB)->A⊗B
On peut donc recommencer, dans la catégorie monoidale symmétrique (cMon_C,⊗):
- un objet en monoïde pour ⊗ est un anneau R
- on a la notion de module pour R. M->R⊗M est le foncteur module libre.
- Si R est commutatif, on a
  le coéq A⊗R⊗B⇉A⊗B->A⊗_R B qui donne un produit tensoriel sur R-Mod
- une algèbre dans R-Mod est une R-algèbre, se donner une R-algèbre S c'est
  la même chose que se donner un anneau S et un morphisme R->Z(S);
  en particulier une R-algèbre commutative S c'est pareil qu'un anneau
  commutative et une application R->S.

Tensor product
--------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tensor+product
The tensor product of modules A⊗_R B B of R-modules A and B can be constructed as the quotient of the tensor product of abelian groups A⊗B underlying them by the action of R: ie as the coeq of A⊗R⊗B⇉A⊗B
If R is a monoid in any monoidal category, we can define the tensor product of a left and a right R-module in an analogous way. If R is a commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category, so that left and right R-modules coincide, then A⊗_RB is again an R-module, while if R is not commutative then A⊗_RB will no longer be an R-module of any sort.
The tensor product of left and right modules over a noncommutative monoid in a monoidal category is a special case of the tensor product of modules for a monad in a bicategory.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/copower
Let V be a closed monoidal category. In a V-enriched category C, the copower of an object x∈C by an object k∈V is an object k⊙x∈C with a natural isomorphism
C(k⊙x,y)≅V(k,C(x,y))
In the V-category V, the copower is just the tensor product of V.

Exemple: si V=Set, on a S⊗b:=∐_s∈S b.

Internal Hom
------------

https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Closed+structure+on+modules+over+a+commutative+monoid

Si R monoïde, M, N des R-modules à gauche,
on peut construire le Hom internet [M,N]_R comme R-module comme étant
l'équalisateur de [M,N]=>[R⊗M,N]


Algèbre commutative
-------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/commutative+algebraic+theory
Definition. T is a commutative monad if there is an equality between two maps
α=β:TA×TB → T(A×B)

Abstract formulation
The category Th of Lawvere theories is endowed with a symmetric monoidal product (called Kronecker product) ⊗:Th×Th→Th
whereby (S⊗T)-algebras are S-algebras internal to T-algebras, or equally well T-algebras internal to S-algebras. A commutative theory is tantamount to a commutative monoid in the symmetric monoidal category Th.
If S and T are commutative theories, then their coproduct in the category of commutative theories is S⊗T.

Commutative theory as monoidal monad:
commutative Lawvere theories on Set are precisely the same things as (finitary) symmetric monoidal monad structures on (Set,×).

The category of algebras for a commutative algebraic theory is canonically a closed symmetric monoidal category:
An algebraic theory is commutative iff its operations are algebra
homomorphisms, so Hom(A,B) is enriched as a model of the algebraic theory,
and we have a closed category of models and homorphisms. Furthermore, this
internal Hom has a left adjoint ⊗ for which the free model on one
generator is a unit, so we have a closed symmetric monoidal category.
A⊗B is the following coequalizer in Alg_T:
  T(TA×TB) →^Tα TT(A×B) 
   T(ξ_A×ξ_B)↘    ↓ m
                T(A×B) → A⊗B

pour la généralisation de × à un tenseur ⊗ dans C:
  Caveat: this construction only works if your category of algebras has coequalizers of reflexive pairs, i.e. coequalizers of parallel pairs of arrows with a common right inverse.
  Let T:C→C be your monad. Being commutative, it comes with maps dst:T(A)⊗T(B)→T(A⊗B). Let ϕ:TA→A and ψ:TB→B be algebras. Then ϕ⊗ψ is the coequalizer in Alg(T) of T(ϕ⊗ψ) and μ∘T(dst) (which is a reflexive pair of morphisms from the free algebra on T(A)⊗T(B) to the free algebra on A⊗B). The unit I in Alg(T) is the free algebra μ:T2(I)→T(I). Moreover, the free functor C→Alg(T) preserves monoidal structure.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+monad
A monoidal monad is a monad in the 2-category of monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, and monoidal transformations.

Let V be a monoidal category. We say a functor T:V→V is strong if there are given left and right tensorial strengths
τ_A,B:A⊗T(B)→T(A⊗B), σ_A,B:T(A)⊗B→T(A⊗B)
which are suitably compatible with one another. The full set of coherence conditions may be summarized by saying T preserves the two-sided monoidal action of V on itself.
If V is symmetric monoidal, we will assume that the left and right strengths τ and σ are related by the symmetry in the obvious way.
A strong monad is a commutative monad if α=β:TA×TB → T(A×B)

Let T be a monoidal monad, with structural constraints on the underlying functor denoted by α_A,B:T(A)⊗T(B)→T(A⊗B),ι=uI:I→T(I).
This induces strengths on both the left and the right, which makes T a commutative monad; in fact α=β=α_A,B

La catégorie des anneaux c'est:

  (au sens logique ou au sens catégorique)
  en particulier c'est les modèles d'un sketch, donc c'est loc de prés fini
- l'algèbre d'Eilenberg-Moore sur Set donné par le foncteur G=anneau libre
  (très lié à la précédente présentation); en particulier Ring est
  monadique sur Set (qui est total), donc Ring est total.
  En fait Set et loc de prés fini et G est accessible, donc on retrouve que
  Ring est loc de prés fini.
  Le foncteur G est la composée de deux foncteurs monoides libres (pour +

- la catégorie des modules sur la catégorie monoidale des groupes abéliens

  dans la catégorie monoidale Set.

Un anneau, c'est aussi une Ab-catégorie avec un objet, ou encore une monade

NOTES ON DERIVED FUNCTORS AND GROTHENDIECK DUALITY Joseph Lipman

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Frobenius+reciprocity
 In category theory, Frobenius reciprocity is a condition on a pair of adjoint functors f_!⊣f^*. If both categories are cartesian closed, then the adjunction is said to satisfy Frobenius reciprocity if the right adjoint f^*:Y→X is a cartesian closed functor: f*(B^A)=~f*(B)^f*(A)

 By the calculus of mates, this condition is equivalent to asking that the canonical “projection” morphism f_!(C×f^*A)→(f_!C)×A
is an isomorphism for each A in Y and C in X. (Fait sens comme "Frobenius repricocity" dans une catégorie non cartésienne close)

Proposition 1.1. In a Wirthmüller context, the projection formula/Frobenius reciprocity holds as a natural equivalence π¯:f_!(f^*(B)⊗A) ⟶≃ B⊗f_!A

Verdier duality gives another link between them: morally speaking, it exchanges "∗" and "!"

Base change. Given continuous maps f : X → Z and g : Y → Z which induce morphisms f¯ : X ×_Z Y → Y and g¯ : X ×_Z Y → X, there exists a canonical isomorphism R f¯_∗ Rg¯^! ≅ Rf^! Rg_∗.

Localisation:
In the particular situation of a closed subspace i: Z ⊂ X and the complementary open subset j: U ⊂ X, the situation simplifies insofar that for j^∗=j^! and i_!=i_∗ and for any sheaf F on X, one gets exact sequences
    0 → j_!j^∗ F → F → i_∗i^∗ F → 0
Its Verdier dual reads
    i∗Ri^! F → F → Rj_∗j^∗ F → i∗Ri^! F[1],
a distinguished triangle in the derived category of sheaves on X.

The adjointness relations read in this case
    i^∗ ⇆ i_∗ = i_! ⇆ i^!
and j_! ⇆ j^! = j^∗ ⇆ j_∗

A Wirthmüller context is a pair of two symmetric closed monoidal categories (𝒳,⊗_X,1_X), (𝒴,⊗_Y,1_Y) which are connected by an adjoint triple of functors such that the middle one is a closed monoidal functor.
This is the variant/special case of the yoga of six operations consisting of two adjoint pairs (f_!⊣f^!) and (f^*⊣f_*) and the tensor product/internal hom adjunctions ((−)⊗B⊣[B,−]), specialized to the case that f^!≃f^*.

A colimit in an over category is computed as a limit in the underlying category.
ie l'incusion reflète les colimites.

For 𝒞 a category, X:𝒟⟶𝒞 a diagram, 𝒞/X the comma category (the over-category if 𝒟 is the point) and F:K→𝒞 a diagram in the comma category, then the limit lim_← F in 𝒞/X coincides with the limit lim_← F/X in 𝒞.

Pullbacks: cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/conservative+functor
Proposition 2.1. Let 𝒞 be a category with pullbacks. Given any morphism f:X⟶Y in 𝒞 write f^*:𝒞/Y⟶𝒞/X
for the functor of pullback along ff between slice categories (base change). If strong epimorphisms in 𝒞 are preserved by pullback, then the following are equivalent:

U:C→S forgetfull; we say that C has discrete objects if U has a fully faithful left adjoint, and codiscrete objects if U has a fully faithful right adjoint. By abstract nonsense, if U has both adjoints, then one is fully faithful if and only if the other is so.

Theorem 1: Suppose C has a terminal object preserved by U. If U is a fibration, then C has codiscrete objects.
Theorem 2: Suppose C has pullbacks preserved by U. If C has codiscrete objects, then U is a fibration.
Thus, if C has finite limits preserved by U, then it has codiscrete objects if and only if it is a fibration.
  
Def: the scone (short for Sierpinski cone) of C over S = the comma category of Id_S over U.
Theorem 3: If C has a terminal object preserved by U, then U′:scn S(C)→S has a fully faithful right adjoint, which takes a∈S to (a,1,!:a→U(1)). Thus scn_S(C) has codiscrete objects.
Theorem 3 is a corollary of Theorem 1, because U′ is always a fibration.

In fact, U′ is the free fibration generated by U: the category of fibrations over S is 2-monadic over Cat/S, and U↦U′ is the 2-monad with unit i_*.
This 2-monad is colax-idempotent, so that U is itself a fibration if and only if i_* has a right adjoint i^! that commutes with U and U′. Therefore, from theorems 1 and 2, we conclude:
  - If C has a terminal object preserved by U and i_* has a right adjoint over S, then C has codiscrete objects. This is easy to see directly by composition of adjoints, since U=U′∘i_* and U′ always has a right adjoint.
  - If C has pullbacks preserved by U and codiscrete objects, then i_* has a right adjoint over S. The adjoint is defined by the pullback
    i^!x → G(a) 
     ↓      ↓ 
     x →  GU(x)
Thus, if we restrict to the category of lex categories and lex functors over S, then we can also regard U′ as the free category-with-codiscrete-objects generated by U.

Dually, of course, we can consider the “co-scone” which is the free opfibration and the free category-with-discrete-objects. However, we also have the following nice fact.

Theorem 4: If U has a left adjoint, then so does U′, which is fully faithful if the left adjoint of U is so. Thus if C has discrete objects, so does scn_S(C).

This means that there must be a distributive law relating the scone and the co-scone, enabling us to talk about joint algebras for the two monads. These joint algebras are, of course, functors into SS which are both fibrations and opfibrations, or equivalently (in the lex and colex case) those having both discrete and codiscrete objects.

Let’s bring it all together by recalling two important examples. Firstly, suppose that C and S are toposes and U is the direct image part of a geometric morphism (thus it has a left-exact left adjoint). Then by Theorem 4, U′ also has a left adjoint, which inherits left-exactness; thus U′ is also the direct image part of a geometric morphism. Finally, i_* always has a left-exact left adjoint i^*, so the morphism i:C→scn_S(C) lives in Topos/STopos/S.

In this case, having codiscrete objects (which then implies also having discrete ones) is called being a local S-topos. The fact that scn_S(C) is the free local S-topos on C appears in C3.6.5 of Sketches of an Elephant. Theorem 2 implies that for any local S-topos, the “global sections” morphism U:C→S is a fibration and opfibration, a useful thing to know. Note that in this case U is not generally faithful.

Secondly, let S=Set and C=Loc be the category of locales, with U the “set of points” functor (also not faithful). Then scn_S(C) is the category of topological systems defined in Steve Vickers’ book Topology via Logic. These are “midway” between topological spaces and locales, having both a frame of opens and a set of points, neither of which is necessarily determined by the other.

There is also a way to recover the usual category of topological spaces. If U:C→S has codiscrete objects, we say that x∈C is concrete if x→GU(x) is a monomorphism. This is equivalent to saying that U is faithful on morphisms with codomain xx. Dually, if C has discrete objects, we say x is co-concrete (“ncrete”?) if FU(x)→x is an epimorphism. This is equivalent to saying that U is faithful on morphisms with domain x. Restricting to the concrete or co-concrete objects are two dual ways to force U to become faithful.

In the case of local toposes, it is often the concrete objects which we are interested in. When C is the category of sheaves on a concrete site, then the concrete objects are precisely the concrete sheaves, which form a quasitopos.

On the other hand, in a category of the form scn_S(C), an object (a,x,a→U(x)) is concrete just when x is subterminal. Thus, in this case (such as the category of topological systems), there are very few concrete objects. However, if C has discrete objects, then (a,x,a→U(x)) is co-concrete just when the adjunct map F(a)→x is an epimorphism. Hence the co-concrete topological systems are precisely the topological spaces.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bifibration
=both a Grothendieck fibration as well as an opfibration.
Therefore every morphism f:b_1→b_2 in a bifibration has both a push-forward f_*:E_b1→E_b2 as well as a pullback f^*:E_b2→E_b1.

## Codomain fibration
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/codomain+fibration 
= sends each morphism (c_1 →f c_2)∈[I,C] to its codomain c_2.

This functor is always an opfibration. It corresponds under the Grothendieck construction to the pseudofunctor C/(−):C→Cat
that sends each object c∈C to the overcategory C/c.

If C has all pullbacks, then the functor is in addition a fibration, hence a bifibration

$ Direct image operation
The direct image along f:c_1→c_2 yields f_!:C/c_1→C/c_2
of overcategories obained by postcomposition with f.

$ Inverse image operation
The inverse image along f:c_1→c_2 yields f*:C/c_2→C/c_1
of overcategories obained by pullback.

=> Adjointness of direct and inverse image f_!⊣f^*

Since the codomain fibration cod:[I,C]→C is a bifibration when C has all pullbacks, there is a notion of monadic descent in this case.

## Descent

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent
Let 𝒞 be a category and 𝒞_(−) a bifibration over it. For f:X⟶Y a morphism in 𝒞 write
(f_!⊣f^*⊣f_*):𝒞_X⟶f_*⟵f^*⟶f_!𝒞_Y
for the corresponding base change adjoint triple and write
(T_f⊣J_f)≔(f^*f_!⊣f^*f_*) for the induced adjoint pair of a monad T and a comonad J.

Descent morphism: 𝒞_Y⟶Desc_𝒞(f).
The morphism f is called (with respect to the given bifibration 𝒞_(−))
  - a descent morphism if this comparison map is a full and faithful functor;
  - an efective descent morphism if the comparison map is an equivalence of categories.

Now the Bénabou-Roubaud theorem states that if 𝒞_(−) satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition, then descent data is equivalent to the structure of an algebra over a monad for T_f (equivalently a coalgebra for J_f), hence is the Eilenberg-Moore category for these (co-)monads
Desc_𝒞(f)≃EM(T_f).
Therefore when 𝒞_(−) satisfies the BC condition, then a morphism f is effective descent precisely if f^*:𝒞_Y→𝒞_X is monadic, and is descent precisely if f^* is of descent type.

$ Descent for the codomain fibration
Let 𝒞 be a locally Cartesian closed category with coequalizers (e.g. a topos). Then effective descent morphisms for the codomain fibration are precisely the regular epimorphisms.

Hence for f:X⟶Y and (f_!⊣f^*⊣f_*):𝒞/X⟶𝒞/Y the induced base change adjoint triple, then 𝒞 /Y is equivalent to the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras over f^*f_! (equivalently: of coalgebras of f^*f_*) precisely if f is an effective epimorphism. (Use conservative pullback along epimorphisms in the monadicity theorem.)

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functor+of+descent+type
A functor is of descent type if it satisfies “half” of the condition to be monadic.

A functor U:B→A is of descent type if
  - it has a left adjoint F:A→B, and
  - for all b∈B the canonical fork FUFUb⇉FUb→b is a coequalizer.
The second condition is equivalent to asking that the comparison functor B→A^UF from B to the Eilenberg-Moore category of the monad UF is fully faithful.

* Detailled exemples of descent:
- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent#ForCodomainFibs
- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent#AlongPrincipalBundle
- $ Monadic descent of modules
  There is a bifibration Mod→Rings from the category of modules over any ring, mapping each module to the ring that it is a module over. This models, dually, an algebraic version of vector bundles over affine schemes.
  Comonadic descent for this bifibration (equivalently monadic descent for its formal dual, Mod^op→Rings^op is the same as descent for a Sweedler coring

Orbifolds as stacks?
Eugene Lerman
    The first goal of this survey paper is to argue that if orbifolds are groupoids, then the collection of orbifolds and their maps has to be thought of as a 2-category. Compare this with the classical definition of Satake and Thurston of orbifolds as a 1-category of sets with extra structure and/or with the "modern" definition of orbifolds as proper etale Lie groupoids up to Morita equivalence.
    The second goal is to describe two complementary ways of thinking of orbifolds as a 2-category:
    1. the weak 2-category of foliation Lie groupoids, bibundles and equivariant maps between bibundles and
    2. the strict 2-category of Deligne-Mumford stacks over the category of smooth manifolds.

[intéressant car ça permet de bien comprendre les groupoides dans le cas
des manifold, et la Morita equivalence en terme de bibundle, de pourquoi on
a besoin de voir les groupoides comme une 2-catégorie et pas juste une
1-catégorie où on inverse les weak equivalence; ça permet de mieux voir ce
qui se passe dans le cadre général des topos; et aussi le lien avec les stacks.]

Locales and Heyting algebras
============================

## Lattices

Rappel: join semi-lattice = poset où tout couple a un suprémum (<=> tout
ensemble fini a un supremum).
lattice = join and meet semi-lattice.

complete lattice = partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a
supremum (join) and an infimum (meet). (Note: il suffit d'avoir tous les
supremum, car dans ce cas l'infinum c'est le supremum de tous les éléments
plus petits), et pour ça il suffit d'avoir le suprémum direct + les
suprémum finis).

## Heyting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra

A Heyting algebra is a bounded lattice (with join and meet operations written ∨ and ∧ and with least element 0 and greatest element 1) equipped with a binary operation a → b of implication such that c ∧ a ≤ b is equivalent to c ≤ a → b.

<=> A Heyting algebra H is a bounded lattice that has all exponential objects,
ie a->b est l'adjoint de a^b.

<=> f_a(x):= a ^ x a un adjoint de Galois g_a(x)=a->x.

On peut encore voir  →, ∧ and ∨, ⊥=0 and ⊤=1 dans H comme satisfaisant les
axiomes de la logique intuitionniste.

Exemple: Every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra when a → b is defined
as usual as ¬a ∨ b.

Pour une algèbre de Heyting, on peut définir ¬a := a→0
- Réguliers: x est régulier, si x=¬y ou de manière équivalente x=¬¬x (car ¬¬¬=¬).
- Compléments: Elements x and y of a Heyting algebra H are called complements to each other if x∧y = 0 and x∨y = 1. If it exists, any such y is unique and must in fact be equal to ¬x. We call an element x complemented if it admits a complement. It is true that if x is complemented, then so is ¬x, and then x and ¬x are complements to each other. However, confusingly, even if x is not complemented, ¬x may nonetheless have a complement (not equal to x). In any Heyting algebra, the elements 0 and 1 are complements to each other. For instance, it is possible that ¬x is 0 for every x different from 0, and 1 if x = 0, in which case 0 and 1 are the only regular elements.
Any complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular, though the converse is not true in general. In particular, 0 and 1 are always regular.

Prop: H est booléenne <=> tous les x sont réguliers <=> tous les x sont complémentés.
Le sous-ensemble de H des x réguliers (resp complémentés) forment une
algébre booléenne (sauf que pour H_rég il faut faire attention que x ∨reg y = ¬(¬x ∧ ¬y)).

Complétude:
    - The formula F is provably true in intuitionist propositional calculus.
<=> - The identity F ( a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ) = 1 is true for any Heyting algebra H and any elements a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ∈ H.
Note: pour la logique classique, il suffit de vérifier la formule dans
l'algèbre de Boole canonique {0,1}.

## Algèbre de Heyting complète

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Heyting_algebra
Consider a partially ordered set (P, ≤) that is a complete lattice. Then P is a complete Heyting algebra if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
    1) P is a Heyting algebra, i.e. the operation ( x ∧ − ) has a right adjoint (also called the lower adjoint of a (monotone) Galois connection), for each element x of P.
    2) For all elements x of P and all subsets S of P, the following infinite distributivity law holds: x ∧ ⋁ s ∈ S s = ⋁ s ∈ S ( x ∧ s ) .
    3) P is a distributive lattice, i.e., for all x, y and z in P, we have
    x ∧ ( y ∨ z ) = ( x ∧ y ) ∨ ( x ∧ z ) and the meet operations ( x ∧ − ) are Scott continuous for all x in P (i.e., preserve the suprema of directed sets) .

Exemple: The system of all open sets of a given topological space ordered by inclusion is a complete Heyting algebra.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology

Une complete Heyting algebra c'est aussi une frame. Cependant dans Frame,
les morphismes sont (necessarily monotone) functions that preserve finite meets and arbitrary joins. Mais pour être un morphisme d'algèbre de Heyting complète, il faut aussi préserver =>. Locale c'est la catégorie duale de Frame.

## Stone duality

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Stone+duality

A Stone space is by definition a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff
topological space.
The category of Stone spaces is dual to the category of Boolean algebras. The Boolean algebra corresponding to a Stone space consists of its clopen sets.

$ Stone spaces and profinite sets

Note that a finite Stone space is necessarily discrete, and these correspond to the finite Boolean algebras, i.e. FinSet≃FinStoneTop≃FinBool^op. However, since Boolean algebras form a locally finitely presentable category, we have Bool≃Ind(FinBool)≃Pro(FinSet)^op. In consequence, StoneTop≃Pro(FinSet): i.e. Stone spaces are equivalent to profinite sets, in this context then often called profinite spaces.

One way of explaining this classical Stone duality is hence via the following sequence of equivalences of categories
Bool≃Ind(FinBool)≃Ind(FinSet^op)≃Pro(FinSet)^op=StoneTop^op

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/atomic+Boolean+algebra
  a is an atom in A if a is minimal among non-trivial (non-bottom) elements of AA. That is, given any b∈A such that b≤a, either b=0 or b=a.
  A atomic si tout élément b=⋁_I a_i pour des atomes a_i.
  https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/complete+Boolean+algebra
  complete atomic Boolean algebras are (up to isomorphism) precisely power sets.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_duality
On a un foncteur O:Top=>Locale, qui à f:X->Y associe les préimages sur les
ouverts. Ce foncteur a un adjoint S:Locale=>Top définit ainsi:
S(A)=spectrum A, les points sont les applications P(*)->A, si a \in A on
définit U_a comme l'ensemble des points p, tel que p* P(*)->A satisfait p*(a)={*}, ce qui donne un morphisme A->P(S(A)), et donc à f:A->B on associe S(f)(p)=fop.

Cette adjonction donne une équivalence de catégorie entre les espaces topos
sobres et les locales spatiales. X est sobre ssi X->S(O(X)) est bijectif,
et A est spatiale ssi A->O(S(A)) est injectif (c'est toujours surjectif),
ie if not a ≤ b, then there is a point p in pt(A) such that p(a) = 1 and p(b) = 0.

Rappel: sober space = every irreducible closed subset of X is the closure of exactly one point of X; T2 (Hausdorff) => Sober => T0. Exemple: the underlying topological space of any scheme is a sober space, et les sober space de la forme Spec(A), A anneau commutatif sont appelés spectral space.

Cas particulier:
- The category CohSp of coherent sober spaces (and coherent maps) is
equivalent to the category CohLoc of coherent (or spectral) locales (and
coherent maps). The significance of this result stems from the fact that CohLoc in turn is dual to the category DLat of distributive lattices. Hence, DLat is dual to CohSp – one obtains Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices
[Distributive lattice: join and meet distribute over each other.
 Coherent space: the collection of compact open subsets of X is closed under finite intersections and form a basis for the topology of X.
]
- When restricting further to coherent sober spaces that are Hausdorff, one obtains the category Stone of so-called Stone spaces. On the side of DLat, the restriction yields the subcategory Bool of Boolean algebras. Thus one obtains Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras.
[Rappel: A Boolean algebra is a complemented distributive lattice, où
équivalently on a ¬, ∧ and ∨, ⊥ and ⊤ avec les bons axiomes]
 => A concrete Boolean algebra or field of sets is any nonempty set of
 subsets of a given set X closed under the set operations of union,
 intersection, and complement relative to X, et Stone's rep theorem =>
 toute algèbre booléenne est concrète.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%27s_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras
Each Boolean algebra B has an associated topological space, denoted here S(B), called its Stone space. The points in S(B) are the ultrafilters on B, or equivalently the homomorphisms from B to the two-element Boolean algebra. The topology on S(B) is generated by a (closed) basis consisting of all sets of the form
    { x ∈ S ( B ) ∣ b ∈ x } ,
where b is an element of B. This is the topology of pointwise convergence of nets of homomorphisms into the two-element Boolean algebra.

For every Boolean algebra B, S(B) is a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space; such spaces are called Stone spaces (also profinite spaces). Conversely, given any topological space X, the collection of subsets of X that are clopen (both closed and open) is a Boolean algebra.

Stone's representation theorem states that every Boolean algebra B is isomorphic to the algebra of clopen subsets of its Stone space S(B). The isomorphism sends an element b∈B to the set of all ultrafilters that contain b.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_space
Let X be a topological space and let K∘(X) be the set of all compact open subsets of X. Then X is said to be spectral if it satisfies all of the following conditions:
    X is compact and T0.
    K∘(X) is a basis of open subsets of X.
    K∘(X) is closed under finite intersections.
    X is sober, i.e. every nonempty irreducible closed subset of X has a (necessarily unique) generic point.
[ie X coherent sober space et compact]

Equivalent descriptions
Let X be a topological space. Each of the following properties are equivalent to the property of X being spectral:
  - X is homeomorphic to a projective limit of finite T0-spaces.
  - X is homeomorphic to the spectrum of a bounded distributive lattice L. In this case, L is isomorphic (as a bounded lattice) to the lattice K∘(X) (this is called Stone representation of distributive lattices).
  - X is homeomorphic to the spectrum of a commutative ring.
  - X is the topological space determined by a Priestley space.
X is a T0 space whose frame of open sets is coherent (and every coherent frame comes from a unique spectral space in this way. [Hum ça me semble faux, on va plutôt obtenir les bounded coherent frame comme ça]).

Let S denote the ∞-category of spaces. For any ∞-topos X, there is an essentially unique geometric morphism π∗:S→X. The ∞-topos X has the form S/A if and only if the geometric morphism π∗ is etale.
The construction A↦S/A gives a fully faithful embedding from the ∞-category of spaces to the ∞-category of ∞-topoi.

To get a closer analogue of Stone duality, note that the ∞-category of ∞-topoi admits small limits. Consequently, the functor A↦S/A extends formally to a functor F from Pro-spaces to ∞-topoi which commutes with filtered inverse limits. This functor F is not fully faithful, but it is fully faithful when restricted to profinite spaces (that is, Pro-spaces which can be represented by filtered diagrams of spaces which have only finitely many homotopy groups, each of which is required to be finite). You therefore get an embedding θ: { Profinite spaces } ↪ { ∞-topoi } which is a better analogue of Stone duality. In fact, it generalizes Stone duality: the RHS contains the ordinary category of sober topological spaces as a full subcategory, the LHS contains the ordinary category profinite sets as a full subcategory, and on the latter subcategory θ restricts to the usual fully faithful embedding { Profinite sets } ≃ { Stone Spaces } ↪ {sober topological spaces}.

Topos
-----

* Topos: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topos
Rappel: an elementary topos is a category which has finite limits, is cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. There are alternative ways to state the definition; for instance, has finite limits and has power objects.
=> finitely cocomplete.

$ From locally presentable categories to toposes

There is a canonical forgetful functor U:Topos that lands, by definition, in the sub-2-category of locally presentable categories and functors which preserve all limits / are right adjoints.
This 2-functor has a right 2-adjoint.

$ Limits and colimits

The 2-category Topos is not all that well-endowed with limits, but its slice categories are finitely complete as 2-categories, and ShTopos is closed under finite limits in Topos/SetTopos/Set. In particular, the terminal object in ShToposes is the topos Set≃Sh(*).

Proposition 2.1. All small (indexed) 2-colimits in ShTopos exists and are computed as (indexed) 2-limits in Cat of the underlying inverse image functors

Proposition 2.3. The 2-category Topos is an extensive category. Same for toposes bounded over a base.

Prop 2.4: the pullback in the (2,1)-category version of Topos is computed, roughly, by the pushout of their sites of definition

Remark 2.5. For localic toposes this reduces to the statement of localic reflection: the pullback of toposes is given by the of the underlying locales which in turn is the pushout of the corresponding frames.

* Topos classifiant: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/classifying+topos

* Topos are extensive: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/toposes+are+extensive
Every elementary topos is a finitary extensive category. In fact, more is true: if an elementary topos has coproducts indexed by any arity class κ, then it is κ-extensive. In particular, a cocomplete elementary topos is infinitary extensive.

* Boolean topos
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Boolean+topos

- Every subobject has a complement (the general definition of Boolean category).
- Every subobject lattice is a Boolean algebra.
- The subobject classifier Ω is an internal Boolean algebra.
- The maps ⊤,⊥:1→Ω are a coproduct cone (so in particular, Ω≅1+1, and in fact this is enough, because the map [⊤,⊥]:1+1→Ω is always a monomorphism, and any monic endomorphism of Ω is an automorphism).

* In a topos, the contravariant powerset functor P:A -> Ω^A is right
adjoint to P^op, so is monadic and E^op is its category of algebras.
Sine E has all finite limits, E^op as a category of algebras too, so this
give a proof that a topos has finite colimits.

Points
------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/point+of+a+topos

Definition 1.3. A topos is said to have enough points if isomorphy can be tested stalkwise, i.e. if the inverse image functors from all of its points are jointly conservative.

- In presheaf toposes

Proposition 2.1. For C a small category, the points of the presheaf topos [C^op,Set] are the flat functors C→SetC \to Set:
there is an equivalence of categories Topos(Set,[C op,Set])→←FlatFunc(C,Set).

- In localic sheaf toposes
For the special case that E=Sh(X) is the category of sheaves on a category of open subsets Op(X) of a sober topological space X the notion of topos points comes from the ordinary notion of points of X.
For notice that
    - Set=Sh(*) is simply the topos of sheaves on a one-point space.
    - geometric morphisms f:Sh(Y)→Sh(X) between sheaf topoi are in a bijection with continuous functions of topological spaces f:Y→X; for this to hold X needs to be sober.
    The inverse image of a point is then the stalk.

- In sheaf toposes
The following characterization of points in sheaf toposes a special case of the general statements at morphism of sites.
Proposition 2.2. For C a site, there is an equivalence of categories
Topos(Set,Sh(C))≃Site(C,Set).
(Morphisms of sites C→Set are precisely the continuous flat functors.)

Proposition 2.3. If E is a Grothendieck topos with enough points (def. 1.3), there is a small set of points of E which are jointly conservative, and therefore a geometric morphism Set/X→E, for some set X, which is surjective.

- In classifying toposes
From the above it follows that if E is the classifying topos of a geometric theory T, then a point of E is the same as a model of T in Set.

- Of toposes with enough points
Proposition 2.5. If a sheaf topos E has enough points (def. 1.3) then
  - there exists a topological space X whose cohomology and homotopy theory is the intrinsic cohomology and intrinsic homotopy theory of the topos;
  - such that E is the category of equivariant objects in the sheaf topos Sh(X) with respect to some groupoid action on X.

The following classes of topos have enough points (def. 1.3).
  - every presheaf topos;
  - every coherent topos (due to the Deligne completeness theorem);
  - every Galois topos.

Over topos
----------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/over-topos

For 𝒯 a topos and X∈𝒯 any object the over category 𝒯/X – the slice topos or over-topos – is itself a topos: the “big little topos” incarnation of X. This fact is sometimes called the “Fundamental Theorem of Topos Theory”.
More generally, given a fibred product-preserving functor u:E→F between toposes, the comma category (id_F/u) is again a topos, called the Artin gluing.

Preuve: X×−:𝒯→𝒯 is a pullback preserving comonad, 𝒯/X est sa catégorie de
coalgèbre est donc un topos.

The subobject classifier of 𝒯/X is the projection Ω×X→X.

$ Étale geometric morphism
Proposition 3.1. For 𝒯 Grothendieck topos and X∈𝒯 any object, the canonical projection functor X_!:𝒯/X→𝒯 is part of an essential geometric morphism
(X_!⊣X^*⊣X_*):𝒯/X →X_*←X^*→X_! 𝒯.
Note: - The functor X^* is given by taking the product with X
      - in terms of the internal logic of 𝒯 the functor X_! is the existential quantifier ∃ and X_* is the universal quantifier ∀.

Definition 3.3. A geometric morphism ℰ→𝒯 of this form is called an etale geometric morphism.

$ Base change

Proposition 3.4. For ℰ a Grothendieck topos and f:X→Y a morphism in ℰ, there is an induced essential geometric morphism
(f_!⊣f^*⊣f_*):ℰ/X →f_*←f^*→f_! ℰ/Y
where f_! is given by postcomposition with f and f^* by pullback along X.

[voir aussi https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/base+change
For f:X→Y a morphism in a category C with pullbacks, there is an induced functor f^*:C/Y→C/X of over-categories. This is the base change morphism. If C is a topos, then this refines to an essential geometric morphism
(f_!⊣f^*⊣f_*):C/X→C/Y où f_! correspond à il existe et f_* à pour tout:
∑_f⊣f^*⊣∏_f):C/X →f_*←f^*→f_! C/Y

Proof: That we have adjoint functors (f_!⊣f^*) follows directly from the universal property of the pullback. The fact that f^* has a further right adjoint is due to the fact that it preserves all small colimits by the fact that in a topos we have universal colimits[=stable by pullback] and then by the adjoint functor theorem theorem.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pullback-stable+colimit
More generally, colimits are stable in any locally cartesian closed category, since in that case the pullback functors f^* all have right adjoints
]

$ Presheaf over-topos
Proposition 3.5. There is an equivalence of categories
e:PSh(C/c)→≃PSh(C)/Y(c).

Plus généralement:
Proposition 3.8. Let P:C^op→Set. Then there is an equivalence of categories
PSh(∫_C P)≃PSh(C)/P. [∫_C P est la catégorie des éléments de P]

$ Geometric morphisms by slicing
Proposition 3.9. For (f^*⊣f_*):𝒯→ℰ a geometric morphism of toposes and X∈ℰ any object, there is an induced geometric morphism between the slice-toposes
(f^*/X⊣f_*/X):𝒯/f^*X→ℰ/X,
where the inverse image f^*/X is the evident application of f^* to diagrams in ℰ.

$ Topos points
Observation 3.10. Let ℰ be a topos, X∈ℰ an object and
(e^*⊣e_*):Set→ℰ a point of ℰ. Then for every element x∈e^*(X) there is a point of the slice topos ℰ/X given by the composite
(e,x):Set →x_*←x^* Set/e^*(X) →e_*/X←e^*/X ℰ/X.
Here (e^*/X⊣e_*/X) is the slice geometric morphism of e over X discussed above and (x^*⊣x_*) is the étale geometric morphism discussed above induced from the morphism * →x e^*(X)

Hence the inverse image of (e,x) sends A→X to the fiber of e^*(A)→e^*(X) over x.

Corollary 3.11. If ℰ has enough points then so does the slice topos ℰ/X for every X∈ℰ.

Constructing topos
------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topos+of+coalgebras+over+a+comonad
Proposition 2.1. Let ℰbe a topos. Then
  - if a comonad T:ℰ→ℰ is left exact, then the category of coalgebras TCoAlg(ℰ) is itself an (elementary) topos.
    Moreover,
      - the cofree/forgetful adjunction (U⊣F):ℰ →F←U TCoAlg(ℰ) is a geometric morphism.
    [Note: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/surjective+geometric+morphism
     these morphisms are exactly the surjective geometric morphisms]
      - If T is furthermore accessible and ℰ is a sheaf topos, then also TCoAlg(ℰ) is a sheaf topos.
      - Even if T is merely pullback-preserving, the category of coalgebras is a topos.
  - Therefore, if a monad T:ℰ→ℰ has a right adjoint, then the category of algebras TAlg(ℰ) is itself an (elementary) topos. (Because the right adjoint of a monad carries a comonad structure, evidently a left exact comonad, and there is a canonical equivalence between the category of algebras over the monad and the category of coalgebras over the comonad.)
  - If a monad on a topos is pullback-preserving and idempotent, then the category of algebras is a subtopos (hence the category of sheaves for some Lawvere-Tierney topology).

Exemple: For (f^*⊣f_*):ℰ→ℱ any geometric morphism, the induced comonad
f^*f_*:ℰ→ℰ is evidently left exact, hence (f^*f_*)CoAlg(ℰ) is a topos of
coalgebra.
-> Cf https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent

* https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Three+topos+theorems+in+one

  - Slice theorem: If E is a topos and X is an object, then E/X is a topos.
  - Lex comonad theorem: If G:E→E is a left exact comonad acting on a topos E, then the category of G-coalgebras is also a topos.

If the slice theorem is the one which passes to toposes of presheaves on internal discrete categories, then the lex comonad theorem is the one which, among other things, extends that further to toposes of presheaves on general internal categories.

  - Lex idempotent monad theorem: If J:E→E is a left exact idempotent monad acting on a topos E, then the category of J-algebras is also a topos.

This is the theorem which takes us from presheaves to sheaves. Here the monad J is the composite of taking the associated sheaf functor (which is left exact) followed by the forgetful functor from sheaves to presheaves; the J-algebras are the sheaves. The monad J is idempotent because the associated sheaf of a sheaf X is canonically isomorphic to X (alternatively, because the embedding of sheaves in presheaves is full and faithful). In fact, every such lex idempotent monad on a topos E arises in this way, by sheafifying with respect to a Lawvere-Tierney topology in E.

The first reduction combines the slice theorem and the lex comonad theorem into one. The idea is rather simple. Indeed, notice that the slice E/X is the category of coalgebras for the comonad −×X:E→E, where the comonad structure comes from the unique comonoid structure which exists on any object X:
δ:X→X×X ε:X→1

The comonad −×X isn’t left exact (it doesn’t preserve the terminal object), but it does preserve pullbacks.

Theorem 2.1. If G:E→E is a pullback-preserving comonad acting on a topos E, then the category of coalgebras E_G is also a topos.

Application: if C is an internal category in a topos E, there is a comonad
such that coalgebras of this comonad G:E→E are exactly internal presheaves on C, and theorem 1 shows that the category of presheaves is a topos.

Theorem 2: Let (G,δ) be a strict modal operator on a topos E. Then the category of G-structures E_G is also a topos.

Application: given an internal site (C,j) in E, a (strict) modal operator G:E→E such that the category of sheaves Sh(C,j) is equivalent to the category of G-structures

Note: un modal operator est G tel que on ait une application G->GG tel que
G ->  GG  soit un pullback, et il est strict si 1_G1=G1->GG1->G1.
|      |
GG -> GGG
Une G-structure c'est un objet X tel que X -> GX soit un pullback -> category E_G
                                         GX-> GGX
Rem: G-structures really are the same things as G-coalgebras or G-algebras, where G is either a pullback-preserving comonad or a lex idempotent monad, seen as a modal operator.

Note: if H is a modal operator on E_G, then we have a round trip operator
K: E -G> E_G -H-> E_G -U> E, and
Theorem 3: (K,λ) defines a modal operator on E, and E_K≃(E_G)_H. If the modal operators G and H are strict, then so is K.

Topos de Grothendieck
---------------------

Topos de Grothendieck: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+topos
 Every Grothendieck topos is a locally presentable category,
 a total category and a cototal category [car il est (co)complet,
 (co)wellpowered et a un (co)generator: ].

### Caractérisations

* (Street) A category E is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is κ or less.
This result is in the spirit of saying “every Grothendieck topos is the category of sheaves with respect to the canonical topology on itself”.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+topos#Giraud
Giraud's theorem characterises a Grothendieck topos as follows:
  - a locally small category with a small generating set,
  - with all finite limits,
  - with all small coproducts, which are disjoint, and pullback-stable,
  - where all congruences have effective quotient objects, which are also pullback-stable.
These conditions are equivalent to
  - a locally small infinitary pretopos (=infinitary extensive + exact) with a small generating set.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf+toposes+are+equivalently+the+left+exact+reflective+subcategories+of+presheaf+toposes

Proposition 1.1. Let (𝒞,τ) be a small site. Then the full subcategory inclusion i:Sh(𝒞,τ)↪PSh(𝒞) of its category of sheaves (Grothendieck topos) into its category of presheaves is a reflective subcategory inclusion
Sh(𝒞,τ)⊥↪i⟵LPSh(𝒞) such that the reflector L:PSh(𝒞)→Sh(𝒞) preserves finite limits (the reflector being sheafification).

Moreover, up to equivalence, every Grothendieck topos arises this way: Given a small category 𝒞 there is a bijection between
  - the equivalence classes of left exact reflective subcategories ℰ↪PSh(𝒞) of the category of presheaves
  - Grothendieck topologies τ on 𝒞 which is such that ℰ≃Sh(𝒞,τ)

Cf geometric embedding: une réflexion exacte dans un topos (=geometric
embedding) vient d'une
topologie \tau; sur les préfaisceaux les topologies viennent d'un site:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere-Tierney+topology
Proposition 3.2. For C a small category and E:=[C op,Set] its presheaf topos, Lawvere–Tierney topologies in E are equivalent to Grothendieck topologies on C.

Proposition 1.2. (accessible embedding is implied)
In the situation of prop. 1.1 it follows that the inclusion i:Sh(𝒞,τ)↪PSh(𝒞) is an accessible functor, hence an accessible reflective subcategory inclusion.
Pr: Sh(𝒞,τ) and PSh(𝒞) sont des topos de Grothendieck, donc loc.
présentables, donc les adjonctions sont accessibles (having a left adjoint
forces accessibility).

  Definition 3.4. A separating family in a fibered category P:E→B is an object S∈E such that for every parallel pair f,g:A→B in E with f≠g and P(f)=P(g) there exist arrows c:X→S and h:X→A (constituting a span) such that c is P-cartesian, and fh≠gh; autrement dit S est localement séparant]

  Bounded geometric morphisms are stable under composition.

  Th: bounded toposes over 𝒮 are precisely the toposes of 𝒮-valued internal sheaves on internal sites in 𝒮.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/hypercover
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sieve

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coverage
If {f_i:U_i→U} i∈I is a covering family and g:V→U is a morphism, then there exists a covering family {h_j:V_j→V} such that each composite gh_j factors through some f_i.

$ Sheaves:
For any collection of elements x_i∈X(U_i) such that, whenever g:V→U_i and h:V→U_j are such that f_i g = f_j h, we have X(g)(x_i)=X(h)(x_j), then there exists a unique x∈X(U) such that X(f_i)(x)=x_i for all i.

A site C is subcanonical if every representable functor C(−,c):C^op→Set is a sheaf If C is subcanonical, then its Yoneda embedding C→[C^op,Set] factors through Sh(C). If C is small, then Sh(C) is reflective in [C^op,Set] and a Grothendieck topos.

If C has pullbacks, by saturation we can assume that if f_i: U_i->U is a coverage and v: V->U, the pullbacks g* f_i: g*U_i->V is a coverage.
One can also impose the weaker condition that the pullbacks of covering families exist and are covering families, even if not all pullbacks exist in C. The saturation conditions below imply that on a category with pullbacks, every coverage is equivalent to one satisfying this stronger condition, which perhaps we may call a cartesian coverage.
If C has pullbacks, X is a sheaf <=> 
X(U)→∏_i∈I X(U_i) ⇉ ∏_j,k∈I X(U_j ×_U U_k).is an equalizer

$ Saturations (which don't change the prop of being a sheaf):
- Add {1_U} to the covering families
- If f_i: U_i->U is a covering family and g_ij: U_ij -> U_i is, then add
  f_i o g_ij: U_ij -> U
- If f_i: U_i->U is a covering family and g_j: V_j -> U is such that each
  f_i factors through a g_j, then add g_j as a covering family
- If f_i: U_i->U is a family, then the sieve it generates is {g: V->U} such
  that g factors through one f_i. X is a sheaf for f_i <=> it is a sheaf
  for the sieve it generates

$ Grothendieck pretopology or basis for a Grothendieck topology is commonly used for a coverage (often of the stronger sort requiring stability by pullbacks) that also satisfies
  - isomorphism cover: Every isomorphism is a covering family.
  - transitivity: If {f_i:U_i→U}_i∈I is a covering family and for each i, so is {h_ij:U_ij→U_i}_j∈J, then {f_i h_ij:U_ij→U}_i∈I,j∈U_i is also a covering family.
    The Grothendieck topology on C generated from a basis of covering families is that for which a sieve {S_i→U} is covering precisely if it contains a covering family of morphisms. Given any Grothendieck topology on C, there is a maximal basis which generates it
    Voir aussi: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+pretopology

$ Grothendieck coverage (commonly called a Grothendieck topology) = a collection of sieves called covering sieves, satisfying the following pullback-stability and saturation conditions. (If R is a sieve on U and g:V→U is a morphism, we define g^*(R) to be the sieve on V consisting of all morphisms h into V such that ghh factors through some morphism in R.)
  - If R is a covering sieve on U and g:V→U is any morphism, then g^*(R) is a covering sieve on V.
  - For each U the sieve M_U consisting of all morphisms into U (the sieve generated by the singleton family {1_U}) is a covering sieve.
  - If R is a covering sieve on U and S is an arbitrary sieve on U such that for each f:V→U in R, f^*(S) is a covering sieve on V, then S is also a covering sieve on U.
One can then show that for every coverage, there is a unique Grothendieck coverage having the same sheaves. When C is small, then Grothendieck coverages on C are also in bijective correspondence with Lawvere-Tierney topologies on its presheaf topos [C^op,Set], and thus in bijection with subtoposes of [C^op,Set].

* Exemples:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coverage
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+pretopology
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+topology
  - Op(X) open subsets.
    A basis for the topology on X is a (subcanonical) coverage on X. (Closed under pullbacks = closed under intersections)
    Open covers = pretopology.
  - Grothendieck pretopologies on Top include:
    Local-section-admitting surjections
    Surjective open maps
    Surjective topological submersions
    Surjective local homeomorphisms
  - On the category Diff of manifolds: the pretopology of surjective submersions.
  - coverage of good open covers, on Diff
  - On any regular category there is a coverage, called the regular coverage, whose covering families are the singletons {f:V→U} where f is a regular epimorphism. It is subcanonical.
    If C is exact or has pullback-stable reflexive coequalizers, then its codomain fibration is a stack for this topology (the necessary and sufficient condition is that any pullback of a kernel pair is again a kernel pair).
  - On any coherent category there is a a coverage, called the coherent coverage, whose covering families are the finite families {f_i:U_i→U} the union of whose images is all of U. It is subcanonical. Likewise there is a geometric coverage on any infinitary-coherent category.
  - On any extensive category there is a coverage, called the extensive coverage, whose covering families are the inclusions into a (finite) coproduct. It is subcanonical. The coherent coverage on an extensive coherent category is generated by the union of the regular coverage and the extensive one (the topology is then superextensive).
    The codomain fibration of any extensive category is a stack for its extensive topology.
  - Any category has a canonical coverage, defined to be the largest subcanonical one. (Hence the name “subcanonical” = “contained in the canonical coverage.”) The covering sieves for the canonical coverage are precisely those which are universally effective-epimorphic, meaning that their target is their colimit and this colimit is preserved by pullback.
  - The canonical coverage on a Grothendieck topos coincides with its geometric coverage, and moreover every sheaf for this coverage is representable. That is, a Grothendieck topos is a (large) site which is equivalent to its own category of sheaves.

### Topologies

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/canonical+topology
The canonical topology on a category C is the Grothendieck topology on C which is the largest subcanonical topology. More explicitly, a sieve R is a covering for the canonical topology iff every representable functor is a sheaf for every pullback of R. Such sieves are called universally effective-epimorphic.
Note: si C est déjà un topos de Grothendieck, alors C≃Sh_canonical(C)

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/subcanonical+coverage
= all representable presheaves on this site are sheave

An alternate definition is that a Grothendieck coverage is subcanonical if and only if all of its covering sieves R↪C(−,U) are effective-epimorphic, meaning that the morphisms f:V→U in R form a colimit cone under the diagram consisting of all morphisms between them over U.

Proof: This is just a reformulation of the sheaf condition.

In fact, since the covering sieves in a subcanonical coverage must also satisfy pullback-stability, they must be not only effective-epimorphic but universally effective-epimorphic (meaning that any pullback of them is effective-epimorphic). It is then easy to see that the canonical coverage consists precisely of all the universally effective-epimorphic sieves.

Note also that if f:V→U is a single morphism having a kernel pair p,q:V×_UV⇉V, then the sieve generated by ff is effective-epimorphic iff f is the coequalizer of its kernel pair, and thus iff f is an effective epimorphism.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/trivial+topology
The Grothendieck topology on any category for which only the identity morphisms are covering is the trivial topology. Its sheaves are all the presheaves.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+coverage
= each covering family has one element which is a regular epimorphism (on a regular category C).

- If C is exact or has pullback-stable reflexive coequalizers, then its codomain fibration is a stack for this topology (the necessary and sufficient condition is that any pullback of a kernel pair is again a kernel pair).
- For 𝒞_𝕋 the syntactic category of a regular theory, the regular coverage makes it the syntactic site, which is a site of defininition for the classifying topos of 𝕋.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherent+coverage
For C a coherent category, the coherent coverage on C is the coverage in which the covering families are generated by finite, jointly regular-epimorphic families.
= generated by single regular epimorphisms and by finite unions of subobjects

The coherent coverage is subcanonical.
  - If C is extensive, then its coherent topology is generated by the regular topology together with the extensive topology. (In fact, the coherent topology is superextensive.)
  - If C is a pretopos, then its self-indexing is a stack for its coherent topology. Exactness and extensivity are stronger than necessary, however; a pair of necessary and sufficient conditions for this to hold are that
      - If R⇉A is a kernel pair, then for any f:B→A, the pullback f^*R⇉B is also a kernel pair (this is equivalent to the codomain fibration [=self indexing] being a stack for the regular topology).
      - If A,B↣C are a pair of subobjects, then for any f:X→A and g:Y→B and any isomorphism f*(A∩B)≅g*(A∩B), the pushout
        f*(A∩B) → X
           ↓      ↓ 
           Y   →  Z
        exists and is also a pullback.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/superextensive+site
A superextensive site is a site whose covering families can be reduced to single covers combined with stable coproducts.

Let C be a finitely extensive category. A Grothendieck topology on C is (finitely) superextensive if it includes the (finitely) extensive topology (generated by families of injections into finite coproducts) and every covering family is generated by a finite one.

Likewise, if C is infinitary-extensive, a topology is infinitary-superextensive if it includes the infinitary-extensive topology (generated by families of injections into small coproducts) and every covering family is generated by a small one. (Of course, the last condition is vacuous if C is small.)

$ Relationship to singleton covers
The basic property of a superextensive site is that one can replace any (finite or small, as appropriate) covering family (j_i:U_i→B) with the single map ∐_i U_i→B. Covers (=single map covering) generate another Grothendieck topology (which is a “singleton pretopology”) T_cov.

Theorem 4.1. A superextensive Grothendieck topology T on an extensive category C is generated by the union of T_cov and the extensive topology T_ext.

$ Compatibility of sheafification
Theorem 4.2. Let C be a finitary superextensive site, and suppose that finite coproducts of covers in C are again covers. If X is a presheaf on C which is a T_ext-sheaf, then the T_cov-sheafification of X is also a T_ext-sheaf, and hence a T-sheaf.

Of course, there is an analogous result for infinitary superextensive sites. With a little more work we can also prove the same thing for stacks and stackification.

This result is especially interesting because sheaves and stacks for the extensive topology are easier to come by than those for some other topologies. For instance, if C is an extensive coherent category, then any internal category in C represents a functor C^op→Cat which is a stack for the extensive topology, but not usually for the coherent topology. However, the coherent topology is superextensive and its covers are precisely the regular epimorphisms, i.e. T_cov is the regular topology. Thus, the ** stackification of an internal category in C relative to the regular topology is still a stack for the extensive topology, and hence also for the coherent topology **.

### Properties of sites
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concrete+sheaf
  https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concrete+site

$ On a concrete site
Definition. A concrete site is a site C with a terminal object * such that
  - the functor Hom C(*,−):C→Set is a faithful functor;
  - for every covering family {f_i:U_i→U} in C the morphism
    ∐_i Hom_C(*,f_i):∐_i Hom C(*,U_i)→Hom C(*,U) is surjective.

Definition. A presheaf X:C^op→Set on a concrete site is a concrete presheaf if for each U∈C the map X˜_U:X(U)→Hom_Set(Hom_C(*,U),X(*)) is injective.
A concrete sheaf is a presheaf that is both concrete and a sheaf.

$ In a local topos
Lemma. The category of sheaves on a concrete site is a local topos.

Definition. Let (Disc⊣Γ⊣Codisc):E ←Codisc →Γ ←Disc S
be a local geometric morphism. Since then by definition S ↪Codisc←Γ E is a subtopos the morphisms V=Γ^−1(isos(S))⊂Mor E that are inverted by Γ are the local isomorphisms with respect to which the objects of S are sheaves/V-local objects in E.
The concrete sheaves are the objects of E that are the V-separated objects.
So the concrete sheaves on C are precisely the separated objects for this Lawvere-Tierney topology on Sh(C) that corresponds to the subtopos Codisc:S↪Sh(C).
i.e. X concrete <=> the (Γ⊣coDisc)-counit X→coDisc ΓX is a monomorphism.

$ 3. Properties
Proposition. The category of concrete sheaves Conc_Γ(E) forms a reflective subcategory of E
S ↪Codisc←Γ Conc_Γ(E) ↪←Conc E which is a quasitopos.
The left adjoint Conc is concretization which sends a sheaf X to the image sheaf
ConcX:U↦Im(X(U)→Hom_Set(Hom_C(*,U),X(*))).

Notice that e_0≔(Γ⊣coDisc):𝒮 →coDisc←Γ ℰ is the canonical topos point of ℰ.
Observation. For every global element (x∈Γ(X)):*→X (for every X∈ℰ) there is a topos point of the form
(e_0,x):𝒮 →x_* ←x^* 𝒮/Γ(X) →coDisc/X ←Γ/X ℰ/X.

Observation. (relative concretization)
Let X∈ℰ be concrete. Then the image under the coDisc/X∘Γ/X-monad of any object (A→X)∈ℰ/X is an object (A˜→X) with A˜ being concrete.
This A˜ is the finest concrete sheaf structure on ΓA that extends ΓA→ΓX to a morphism of concrete sheaves.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concrete+object

Proposition 2.1. For a local topos, write
H conc↪H_{conc} for its full subcategory of concrete objects.
Then there is a sequence of reflective subcategory-inclusions that factor the (Γ⊣coDisc)-adjunction as
Γ⊣coDisc: H ⟶ ↩ H_conc ⟶ ↩ Set

### Morphism of sites

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/restriction+and+extension+of+sheaves

F: Y->X induit des morphismes de préfaisceaux:
F_*: PSh(X,A)→PSh(Y,A)		direct image
F^†:PSh(Y,A)→PSh(X,A)		left adjoint to direct image
F^‡:PSh(Y,A)→PSh(X,A)		right adjoint to direct image

Recall moreover that for f:X→Y any morphism of sites (so correspond to a functor F:=f^t:Y->X respecting coverage), the left adjoint to direct image followed by sheafification (−)¯\bar{(-)} is the inverse image map of sheaves: f^−1:Sh(Y,A)→Sh(X,A)

Now, if the morphism of sites happens to be restriction to a sub-site f:X→U with U∈PSh(X,A) with U carrying the induced topology, then
  - the direct image is called restriction of sheaves;
  - the right adjoint takes sheaves to sheaves and is called extension of sheaves.
Note: the induced topology on U correspond to the forgetful functor 
j^t_{U→X}:(Y_X/U)→X.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/morphism+of+sites
It is defined exactly so as to induce a geometric morphism between toposes of sheaves

f:C->D is a morphism of site if it is covering flat and preserve covering
families.

Note: If C has finite limits and all covering families in D are strong epic, then covering-flatness of f is equivalent to f preserving finite limits, i.e. being a left exact functor, or equivalently to being a representably flat functor.
In general representing flat => covering flat but not the converse.

Example 3.1. If A and B are frames regarded as sites via their canonical coverages, then a morphism of sites A→B is equivalently a frame homomorphism, a function preserving finite meets and arbitrary joins.
Example 3.2: For C a site and U∈C, the comma category (C/U) inherits a topology from C, such that the forgetful functor (C/U)→C constitutes a morphism of sites.
Example 3.3. For C and D regular categories equipped with their regular coverages, a morphism of sites is the same as a regular functor, i.e. a functor preserving finite limits and covers.

Let f:(𝒞,J)→(𝒟,K) be a morphism of sites, with 𝒞 and 𝒟 small. Then precomposition with f defines a functor between categories of presheaves (−)∘f:PSh(𝒟)→PSh(𝒞)
which induce a geometric morphism (f^*⊣f_*):Sh(𝒟,K) →f_*←f^* Sh(𝒞,J)

Conversely:
Proposition 4.3. Let (𝒞,J) be a small site and let (𝒟,K) be a small-generated site. Then a geometric morphism
f:Sh(𝒟,K)→Sh(𝒞,J)
is induced by a morphism of sites (𝒟,K)←(𝒞,J):F precisely if the inverse image functor f^* respects the Yoneda embeddings, i.e. there is a functor F making the following diagram commute:
𝒟       ←F    𝒞 
↓ j_𝒟         ↓ j_𝒞 
Sh(𝒟,K) ←f^* Sh(𝒞,J).

Corollary 4.4. Let (𝒞,J) be a small site and let ℰ be any sheaf topos. Then we have an equivalence of categories
Topos(ℰ,Sh(𝒞,J))≃Site((𝒞,J),ℰ)
between the geometric morphisms from ℰ to Sh(𝒞,J) and the morphisms of sites from (𝒞,J) to the big site (ℰ,C) for C the canonical coverage on ℰ.

Topologies
----------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere-Tierney+topology
A Lawvere–Tierney topology in E is (internally) a closure operator given by a left exact idempotent monad on the internal meet-semilattice Ω.
j:Ω→Ω satisfy:
- j true=true (‘if p is true, then p is locally true’)
- jj=j (‘p is locally locally true iff p is locally true’);
- j∘∧=∧∘(j×j) (‘p∧q is locally true iff p and q are each locally true’)
Note: j is equivalently a subobject J↪Ω

A Lawvere-Tierney topology is the same thing as an internal closure operator on the preorder Ω (aka, a Moore closure on the one-element set), which amounts to the same thing as a natural closure operator on subobjects:
Any subobject inclusion X↪Y in E, consider its characteristic morphism χ_X:Y→Ω. Then j∘χ_X is another morphism Y→Ω, which defines another subobject j_*(X) of Y, taken as the closure of our original subobject. The elements of j_*(X) are those elements of Y that are ‘locally’ in X

Proposition 2.6. A morphism j:Ω→Ω is a Lawvere-Tierney topology, precisely if the corresponding closure operator, satisfies for all X,Y∈E
- A⊂A¯
- A¯¯=A¯
- A∩B¯=A¯∩B¯

Def 2.7: A subobject U->X is dense if U¯=X.

Definition 2.8. An object F∈E is called a j-sheaf if it is a local object with respect to the dense monomorphisms.
This means that F is a j-sheaf if for every dense U↪X the induced morphism
Hom(X,F)→Hom(U,F) is an isomorphism. F is a j-separated presheaf if this morphism is itself a monomorphism.

$ Equivalence with Grothendieck topologies

j a Lawvere-Tierney topology <=> embedding Sh_j(E)↪E.
Proposition 3.2. For C a small category and E:=[C^op,Set] its presheaf topos, Lawvere–Tierney topologies in E are equivalent to Grothendieck topologies on C. (Indeed J give the set of covering sieves)

$ Relation to lex reflectors

Def 3.4: Given a reflector ♯:ℰ →L Sh_j(ℰ)↪ℰ, define for each object X∈ℰ a closure operator
by sending any monomorphism A↪X to c(A):=X x_#X #A.

Proposition 3.5. c_L commutes with pullback (change of base), so is a
universal closure operator.
Topology j: J=closure of 1↪Ω, ie 1↪J is the universal dense morphism,
  so j: Ω→ ♯Ω →{χ_♯true} Ω.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheafification

Recall from the discussion at sheaf that Sh_J(C) is by definition the full subcategory of PSh(C) on the local objects with respect to the morphisms
W={S({U_i}):=lim_→(∐_i,j j(U_i)×_j(U) j(U_j) => ∐_i j(U_i)) → j(U)| {U_i→U}_i∈I ∈J}

1. The localization proposition says that every full subcategory of a locally presentable category on the W-local objects for a small set W of morphisms is a reflective subcategory, given by the localization at these morphisms;
2. By Gabriel-Zisman's theorem every reflective subcategory is the localization at the collection of morphisms inverted by the left adjoint (which by the localization proposition is the saturation of the original set of morphisms).
3. If W satisfies the axioms of a calculus of fractions then, by the discussion there, this localization is equivalently given by the category PSh(C)[W^−1] whose objects are those of PSh(C) and whose morphisms are given by PSh(C)[W^−1](X,A)≃lim_→ X^ →^w X PSh_C(X^,A).

Notice that an object is a local object with respect to the above set of morphisms WW precisely if it is local with respect to the set of all small colimits (in the arrow category Arr(PSh(C)) of such morphims (since the hom-functor PSh_C(−,A) sends colimits in the first argument to limits, and a limit of isomorphisms is an isomorphism).
Let hence W¯ be the completion of A under forming small colimits in Arr(PSh(C)).
We claim that the morphisms in W¯\bar W form a calculus of fractions, and
Sh_j(C)=PSh_C[W¯^-1]

$ Construction.
L(X):U ↦ lim_{U^ →w j(U)} PSh_C(U^,X)
where the colimit on the right is over all w∈W¯.

Observation. By the definition of W¯, the morphisms U^→j(U) in W¯ are colimits of diagrams of covering sieves
U^≃lim_{→{K→U}} S({K_i}) → lim_→ {K→U} j(K).
This means (…) that the above colimit may be computed as two consecutive colimits of the form
lim_{→{S({U_i})→j(U)}} PSh C(S({U_i}),X).
One such application is called the plus construction.

Observation. A morphism S({U_i})→X out of a sieve into any presheaf is in components precisely a matching family of the presheaf Xon the covering {U_i→U}.

$ With values in models for finite-limit theories

Consider a type of structure T defined in terms of an essentially algebraic theory finite limits (such as groups, algebras, modules, etc.), then internal T-models are preserved by both direct images and inverse images of geometric morphisms. Therefore, the adjunction (L⊣i):Sh_J(C)→PSh(C) directly induces an adjunction between T-models in sheaves and presheaves. And since finite limits of sheaves and presheaves are computed pointwise, T-models in the category of (pre)sheaves are the same as (pre)sheaves of T-models-in-Set.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/plus+construction+on+presheaves
PSh(C) →(−)^+ SepPSh(C) →(−)^+ Sh(C)

Definition 2.1.
1. A^+:U↦colim_{(R→U)∈J(U)} A(R) where J(U) denotes the poset of J-covering sieves on U.
2. For U∈C^op we define A^+(U) to be an equivalence class of pairs (R,s) where R∈J(U) and s=(s_f∈A(domf)|f∈R) is a compatible family of elements of A relative to R, and (R,s)∼(R′,s′) iff there is a J-covering sieve R′′⊆R∩R′ on which the restrictions of s and s′ agree.
3. A+:U↦colim_(V↪U)∈W A(V) where W denotes the class W:=(f*)^−1 Core(Sh(C)_1) of those morphisms in PSh(C) which are sent to isomorphisms by the sheafification functor f^* and the colimit is taken over all dense monomorphisms only.

$ 4. Internal description

The plus construction can be described in the internal language of the presheaf topos PSh(C). For a presheaf A, seen as a set from the internal point of view, the separated presheaf A^+ is given by the internal expression
A^+={K⊆A|j(K is a singleton)}/∼
where ∼ is the equivalence relation given by K∼L if and only if j(K=L).

Morphismes
----------

Geometric morphisms:
- embedding: f_* fully faithfull
- surjective: f^* faithfull <=> f^* conservative
- connected: f^* fully faithfull => surjective
- essential: f^* has a left adjoint
- locally connected: S-indexed essential <=> essential + f^* cartesian closed
                     => open
- atomic: f^* is logical <=> f is open and E x_S E => E opens; => loc. connected
- étale: de la forme E/X->E <=> localic + atomic
- open: f^* is Heyting hence preserves first order logic. [Heyting category: coherent + on a ∀_p, right adjoint de p*; Heyting functor: coherent functor that preserves ∀_p]
- bounded: tout objet de E est un subquotient de Bxf*I.
           bounded over Set <=> Grothendieck topos
- localic: bounded with 1 for bound
- local: f connected + right adjoint f^! of f_*

Open, open surjection, atomic, locally connected, bounded, localic maps are stable by pullback.
[Note: for the bicategorical pullback to exist, we usually need to pullback
by a bounded morphism]

Si f o g est open et g surjection, f est open.
Si f o g est loc. connected/atomic et g open surjection, f est loc. connected/atomic.

### Flat functors and morphism of sites

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/flat+functor
cf [flat functors] plus haut
Cf aussi https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/06/flat_functors_and_morphisms_of.html qui contient aussi dans les commentaires des discussions très intéressantes sur la monade sheafication, et la logique interne:

Under what conditions on C and D can we say that F:C→D is covering flat if and only if it preserves finite limits?
=> it suffices for C to have finite limits and for covering families in D to be strong-epic.

- Morphisms of sites:
Therefore, if we were to define a morphism of sites F:C→D to
be a functor which is (1) covering flat and (2) cover-preserving, this
would be sufficient to induce a geometric morphism Sh(D)→Sh(C)
For instance, one nice thing is that the inclusion of any dense sub-site is always a morphism of sites in the new sense, though not necessarily in the classical one.

More importantly, this notion of “morphism of sites” now matches exactly the corresponding theory for classifying topoi. Recall that when E is a topos, geometric morphisms E→[C^op,Set] are equivalent to internally flat, or equivalently covering flat, functors C→E. If C is moreover itself a small site, then geometric morphisms E→Sh(C) are classically known to correspond to internally/covering flat functors which are also cover-preserving—in other words, morphisms of sites in the new sense, where E is equipped with its canonical topology. That means that modulo size issues (which I’ll address in my CT talk), the functor
  Sh(−):Site→Topos^op
(where Site is defined using the new notion of morphism of sites) is left adjoint to the forgetful functor 
  U:Topos^op→Site
which sends a topos to its underlying category equipped with its canonical topology, and a geometric morphism to its inverse image functor. But things are actually even better than that, because U is fully faithful: a functor between Grothendieck topoi is the inverse image functor of a geometric morphism precisely when it is a morphism of sites for the canonical topologies. In other words, the (2-) category of topoi is a reflective subcategory of the (2-)category of sites.

[Attention: si E est lui même de la forme Sh(D), un morphisme E->Sh(C) ne
vient pas forcément d'un morphisme de site C->D; par contre par la
discussion précédente ça vient d'un morphisme de site C->E muni de la
topologie canonique.]

### Geometric morphism

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+morphism
f_* et f^* adjoints tel que f^* est exact (pour les limites finies)

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+embedding
<=>
 - the direct image functor f_* is full and faithful (so that F is a full subcategory of E);
 - the counit ϵ:f^*f_*→Id of the adjunction is an isomorphism
 - there is a Lawvere-Tierney topology on E and an equivalence of categories e:F≃Sh_j E

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/surjective+geometric+morphism
A geometric morphism between toposes (f^*⊣f_*):ℰ→ℱ is surjective or a geometric surjection if it satisfies the following equivalent criteria:
  - its inverse image functor f^* is faithful (in contrast to the direct image being full and faithful as for a geometric embedding);
  - its inverse image functor f^* is conservative;
  - the components X→ f_* f^* X of the adjunction unit are monomorphisms, for all X∈ℱ
  - f^* induces a injective homomorphism of subobject lattices
    Sub(X)↪Sub(f^*X)
  - for all X∈ℱ; f^* reflects the order on subobjects;
  - (f^*⊣f_*) is a comonadic adjunction.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%C3%A9tale+geometric+morphism
= local homéo dans Johnstone
Si T est un topos, X dans T, alors T/X est un topos. Un morphisme S->T est
étale si il est isomorphe à T/X->T.

- étale <=> localic+atomic [donc => essential, loc. connected]
- étale <=> essential + f_! conservative + 
  pour tout diagramme X -> Y <- f_! Z
  [f_! f^* X x_{f^* Y} Z, f_! Z; X, Y] est un pullback
  ie c'est comme la condition de Frobenius que l'on a pour un morphisme
  loc. connected: f_!(f^*(X)×Z) →~ X×f_!(Z), mais au dessus de toute fibre Y.

### Logical morphism

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/logical+functor
Since all the elementary topos structure follows from having finite limits and power objects, it suffices to define a logical functor to preserve these, up to isomorphism

Proposition 3.3. For a logical functor F:ℰ→ℱ having a left adjoint L, the following are equivalent:
  - The induced functor L′:ℱ→ℰ/L1 is an equivalence of categories, i.e. the adjunction L⊣F can be identified with the pullback adjunction ℰ/B⇄ℰ for some B (namely L1).
  - L is conservative.
  - L is faithful.
  - L preserves equalizers.
  - L preserves pullbacks.
=> If a logical functor is right adjoint to a left exact functor, then it is an equivalence of categories.
=> A logical functor is the direct image of a geometric morphism precisely if it is an equivalence.

Déf: a geometric morphism with logical inverse image is called an atomic geometric morphism.
Corollary 3.6. Every atomic geometric morphism is an essential geometric morphism (en fait on a même atomic=>loc. connected).
The following is the main source of examples of atomic geometric morphisms.
Proposition 3.7. The inverse image of any base change geometric morphism, hence in particular of any etale geometric morphism, is a logical morphism.

### Localic and hyperconnected morphism

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/localic+topos
In intrinsic terms, a topos is localic if it is generated under colimits by the subobjects of its terminal object 1.

In equivalent but extrinsic terms, a category is a localic topos if it is equivalent to the category of sheaves on a locale with respect to the topology of jointly epimorphic families.

LocTopos(S)≃(Topos/S)_loc≃Loc(S).

Note: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locale
Proposition 4.14. The functor Sh(−):Locale→Topos has a left adjoint
L:Topos→Locale
given by sending a topos ℰ to the locale that is formally dual to the frame of subobjects of the terminal object of ℰ.

* http://zll22.user.srcf.net/dpmms/slides/2013-06-19-ToposesAsGroupoids.pdf
Si X, Y localic; [X,Y]=~[Sh(X), Sh(Y)]
Sh: X->Sh(X) is essentially surjective into the category of localic toposes
    it has a bicategorical left adjoint and both preserves and reflects bicategorical limits.
Proof. See Theorem 1.4.7 and Remark 1.4.8 in [Johnstone, 2002b, Part C]

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/localic+geometric+morphism
A geometric morphism f:E→F between topoi is localic if every object of E is a subquotient of an object in the inverse image of f: of the form f*(x).
2. Examples
  - Any geometric morphism between localic topoi is localic.
  - Any geometric embedding is localic.
  - Any étale geometric morphism is localic. From the point of view of a base topos F, an étale geometric morphism F/A→F looks like the unique geometric morphism Sh(A)→Set attached to the topos of sheaves over the discrete locale A.
  - If g:C→D is a faithful functor between small categories, then the induced geometric morphism Set C→Set D is localic.
3. Properties
Proposition. A Grothendieck topos is a localic topos if and only if its unique global section geometric morphism to Set is a localic geometric morphism.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/hyperconnected+geometric+morphism
A geometric morphism is hyperconnected if it is (left) orthogonal to a localic geometric morphism.
Definition. A geometric morphism f:E→F between toposes is called hyperconnected if the inverse image functor f^*:F→E
  - is a full and faithful functor (donc hyperconnected => connected)
  - its image is closed under subquotients in E.
Hyperconnected <=> sa localic reflection est le point: Sh(*)=Set.

### Connectivity

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/essential+geometric+morphism
Definition 2.1. Given a geometric morphism (f *⊣f *):E→F, it is an essential geometric morphism if the inverse image functor f^* has not only the right adjoint f_*, but also a left adjoint f_!
Let f^*⊣f_*:ℰ→ℱ a geometric morphism between Grothendieck toposes. Then f
is essential iff f^* preserves small limits iff f^* preserves small products.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+connected+topos
Definition 2.1. An object A in a topos ℰ is called a connected object if the hom-functor ℰ(A,−) preserves finite coproducts.

Equivalently, an object A is connected if it is nonempty (noninitial) and cannot be expressed as a coproduct of two nonempty subobjects.

Definition 2.2. A Grothendieck topos ℰ is called a locally connected topos if every object A∈ℰ is a coproduct of connected objects {A_i}_i∈I, A=∐_i∈I A_i.

It follows that the index set I is unique up to isomorphism, and we write
π_0(A)=I.

This construction defines a functor Π_0:ℰ→Set: A↦π_0(A) which is left adjoint to the constant sheaf functor, the left adjoint part of the global section geometric morphism.
Thus, for a locally connected topos we have
(Π_0 ⊣ LConst ⊣ Γ): ℰ →^Γ ←^Const →^Π_0 Set. This is the connected component functor.

Proposition 2.3. A Grothendieck topos ℰ is locally connected precisely if the global section geometric morphism Γ:ℰ→Set is an essential geometric morphism (Π_0 ⊣ LConst ⊣ Γ):ℰ→Set.
[Preuve: en effet sur Set essential <=> loc connected car tout foncteur est
Set-indexed. Π_0(X)=∐_i∈I *, donc p* Π_0(X)=∐_i∈I A_i connected, et on
doit pouvoir en déduit que X aussi.]

Proposition 3.2. The (loc) constant sheaf-functor Δ:𝒮→ℰ is a cartesian closed functor precisely if ℰ is a locally connected topos.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+connected+site
Let C be a small site; we say it is a locally connected site if all covering sieves of any object U∈C are connected, as full subcategories of the slice category C/U.
=> sheaf toposes over locally connected sites are locally connected toposes

Remark 3.1. If C is locally connected, then every constant presheaf on C is a sheaf.
Pr: The fact that all covering families are inhabited makes the constant presheaves be separated presheaves (see this example) and then the connectedness condition further makes them be sheaves.

On a Π_0(U)=* si U représentable, on en déduit pour X faisceau quelconque,
comme the left adjoint functor Π_0 commutes with the coend and the tensoring in the integrand: Π_0(X)=∫^U∈C X(U)⋅*= colim_{U→X} *.
We may think of this as computing the set of plot-connected components of X.

If C furthermore has a terminal object, then colimits along C^{op} preserve the terminal object, so that Sh(C) is moreover a connected topos.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+connected+geometric+morphism
A geometric morphism (f^*⊣f_*):F⇆E  is locally connected if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
  - It is essential, i.e. f^* has a left adjoint f_!, and moreover f_! can be made into an E-indexed functor.
  - For every A∈E, the functor f^*:E/A→F/f^*A is cartesian closed.
  - f^* commutes with dependent products

If f is locally connected, then it makes sense to think of the left adjoint f_! as assigning to an object of F its “set of connected components” in E. In particular, if f is locally connected, then it is moreover connected if and only if f_! preserves the terminal object

Over the base topos E=Set every connected topos which is essential is automatically locally connected.

Let (𝒞,J) be a site and S be a sieve on the object U. S is called connected when S viewed as a full subcategory of 𝒞/U is connected. The site is called locally connected if every sieve is connected. For a bounded geometric morphism p:ℰ→𝒮 the following holds: p is locally connected iff there exists a locally connected internal site in 𝒮 such that ℰ≃Sh(𝒞,J)

f_! -| f^* est une strong adjunction: [f_!X,A]≃f_*[X,f^*A] ie par Frobenius: f_!(f^*(X)×A)→~ X×f_!(A)
Locally connected toposes are coreflective in Topos.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connected+topos
A geometric morphism p:E→F is connected if its inverse image part p^* is full and faithful.

A Grothendieck topos E is connected if the unique geometric morphism
E→Set=Sh(*) is connected. If E is the topos of sheaves on a topological space X (or more generally a locale), then this is equivalent to the usual definition of connectedness for X.

$ Locally connected and connected

Proposition 2.1. If p:E→F is locally connected, then it is connected if and only if the left adjoint p_! of the inverse image functor (which exists, since p is locally connected) preserves the terminal object.

Exemple: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connected+site
Let C be a locally connected site; we say it is a connected locally connected site if it is also has a terminal object => Sh(C) is a locally connected and connected topos.

[Voir aussi le même énoncé dans https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+connected+topos
Proposition 3.3. If Γ:E→Set is a locally connected topos, then it is also a connected topos — in that LConst is full and faithful — if and only if the left adjoint Π_0 of LConst preserves the terminal object.
Rappel: A topos E is called a connected topos if the left adjoint LConst:Set→E is a full and faithful functor.

Notice that for a connected and locally connected topos, the adjunction Set
↪←Π_0 E exhibits Set as a reflective subcategory of E. We may think then of
Set as being the localization of E at those morphisms that induce
isomorphisms of connected components.]

Proposition 3.1. Connected geometric morphisms are left orthogonal to etale geometric morphisms in the 2-category Topos.
Proposition 3.2. Any locally connected geometric morphism factors as a connected and locally connected geometric morphism followed by an etale one.
Preuve: f:E→S locally connected, factor as E→S/f_!(*)→S
=> on a un fact system (Connected, Etale) dans LCTopos.
=> The category of etale geometric morphisms over a base topos S, which is equivalent to S itself, is a reflective subcategory of the slice 2-category LCTopos/S. The reflector constructs “Π_0 of a locally connected topos.”

Proposition 4.2. Let Γ:ℰ→Set be a connected and locally connected topos and X∈ℰ a connected object, Π_0(X)≃*. Then the over-topos ℰ/X is also connected and locally connected.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strongly+connected+topos
A strongly connected geometric morphism, which is locally connected such that f_! preserves all finite products => preserve * donc est connected.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strongly+connected+site
Let C be a locally connected site; we say it is a strongly connected site if it is also a cosifted category (ie colimit commutes with product) => Sh(C) est strongly connected.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/totally+connected+geometric+morphism
  a totally connected geometric morphism, which is locally connected such that p_! preserves all finite limits.

Totally connected sites
A small site C is called totally connected if
  - C is cofiltered, and
  - Every covering sieve in C is connected, when regarded as a subcategory of a slice category. (ie C est loc. connected)
    The second condition implies that all constant presheaves are sheaves, and hence that the left adjoint Colim:Psh(C)→Set of Const:Set→Psh(C) restricts to Sh(C) to give a left adjoint of LConst. Cofilteredness of C is exactly what is needed for left exactness of Colim:Psh(C)→Set, essentially by definition. Hence the topos of sheaves on any totally connected site is totally connected.
Conversely, one can show that any totally connected topos can be (but need not be) presented by some totally connected site.

### Atomic and Local topos

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/atomic+geometric+morphism

A geometric morphism is called atomic if its inverse image f^* is a logical functor => locally connected.
Atomic + connected => hyperconnected
A localic geometric morphism is atomic precisely if it is an etale geometric morphism.

[Johnstone: f:E->S is atomic <=> f is open and E x_S E => E opens.]

- Barr, Atomic Topos: http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/atom.top.pdf
  Theorem B: f:E->S is atomic <=> pour tout objet X de E, son lattice de sous-objets est isomorphe aux sous-objets d'un Lambda X de S. Dans ce cas Lambda défini en fait le foncteur f_!.

Plus exactement, le sub object lattice d'un objet X est
Hom(X, Ω_E)=Hom(1, Ω_E^X)=Γ(Ω_E^X) et on veut que ce soit isomorphe à Ω_B^ΛX.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/atomic+topos
=Global section is atomic => Boolean
Pr: Set est Boolean, f* est logical donc E est boolean.

Definition 2.2. A non-zero object A of a topos ℰ is an atom if its only subobjects are A and 0.

Theorem 2.3. Let ℰ be a Grothendieck topos. Then the following are equivalent:
  - ℰ is an atomic topos.
  - ℰ is the category of sheaves on an atomic site.
  - The subobject lattice of every object of ℰ is a complete atomic Boolean algebra.
  - ℰ has a small generating set of atoms.
  - Every object of ℰ can be written as a disjoint union of atoms.

ℰ atomic sur Set => ℰ boolean.
Réciproquement: If ℰ is a Boolean Grothendieck topos with enough points then ℰ is atomic.
[Attention que l'on peut avoir des topos atomiques sans points.
  Johnstone C3.5.2: E Grothendieck with enough points, E boolean <=> E->Set is atomic
  C3.5.3: Si E localic (ie E=Sh(X), X locale), E atomic <=> X discrete <=> Boolean et a assez de points;
  Par contre an atomic Set-topos which is not localic need not have enough points: D3.4.14 exemple of a connected atomic topos without a point.]

- Decomposition of atomic toposes
Atomic toposes decompose as disjoint unions of connected atomic toposes. Connected atomic toposes with a point are the classifying toposes of localic groups.

- Ex: A category of presheaves Set^𝒞^op is atomic precisely iff 𝒞 is a groupoid
- Dubuc: connected atomic topos is a connected, locally connected and boolean topos.
  Preuve: comme tout X se décompose en X_i connexes (car X loc. connexe),
  il faut montrer que X connexe => X atomique. Mais comme X booléen, s'il
  avait un sous objet Y, on aurait un complément, absurde.

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/atomic+site
= the covering sieves S of J_at are exactly the inhabited sieves S≠∅
=> Sh(C, J_at) est atomique

- Cf la discussion de
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2018/10/topoi_of_gsets.html pour une
intuition sur les topos atomiques et les atomic geometric morphisms.

  Suppose f:E→S is atomic, so that f^*:S→E is logical. Then in particular, f^* preserves the subobject classifier, which means by adjunction that its left adjoint f_! preserves subobject lattices. In other words, the lattice of subobjects of A∈E coincides with the lattice of subobjects of f_!A∈S. Thus, from the perspective of S, a subobject of A is uniquely determined by which of the “atomic components” (elements of f_! A) that it contains: each of these is “uncuttable” and AA is just a collection of these.
  The paper of Barr and Diaconescu shows that atomicity of an arbitrary geometric morphism p:E→S is equivalent to saying that every object p_*(Ω^A) — the “subobject lattice of A∈E to the eyes of S” — is isomorphic to some power-object Ω^B in S, where in fact B=p_!(A). They don’t seem to state this explicitly, but surely such an isomorphism decomposes A as an S-indexed coproduct of “atoms” in the constructive sense, with B=p_!(A) as indexing object, and the existence of such decompositions should conversely imply atomicity.
  For any bounded atomic morphism p:E→S we can choose a site of definition for E consisting of objects A which are connected, i.e. satisfy p_!(A)≅1. In the case when p is atomic, connected objects of E are generally called atoms… an atom A has the property that… the map Sub_S(1)→Sub_E(A)… is biective.
  En particulier si E atomique au dessus de S=Set, un atomic component dans
  Set est {*}, donc un atomic object X dans E est un objet qui n'a que 0 et
  X comme sous-objet, et tout objet dans E est somme d'objets atomiques.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/local+geometric+morphism
f: geometric morphism +  right adjoint f^!:S→E +  (<=>)
  - The right adjoint f^! is an S-indexed functor.
  - f is connected, i.e. f^* is fully faithful.
  - The right adjoint f^! is fully faithful.
  - The right adjoint f^! is cartesian closed.

 A sheaf topos 𝒯 is a local topos if the global section geometric morphism 𝒯 →Γ←LConst Set has a further right adjoint CoDisc, making an adjoint triple (LConst⊣Γ⊣CoDisc):Set↪𝒯. (As just stated, it is automatic in the case over Set that this is furthermore a full and faithful functor.)

 Another way of stating this is that a Grothendieck topos is local if and only if the terminal object 1 is connected and projective (since this means precisely that Γ=hom(1,−) preserves colimits, and therefore has a right adjoint by virtue of an adjoint functor theorem)
 [Note: si un objet X a un right adjoint pour le foncteur hom interne [X,-],
 on dit qu'il a un amazing right adjoint: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/amazing+right+adjoint]

Remark: en général dans une catégorie extensive, on dit que X est connected as soon as hom(X,−) preserves binary coproducts, et tiny (ou small-projective) si hom(X,−) préserve les small colimits.

Note: a coproduct-preserving functor between toposes preserves coequalizers as soon as it preserves epimorphisms, since any coequalizer can be constructed as the quotient of an equivalence relation generated using images and countable coproducts and quotients of equivalence relations are effective. Thus, we can say that a Grothendieck topos is local iff hom(1,−) preserves binary coproducts and epis. Moreover, a cospan A→C←BA \to C \leftarrow B in a topos is a coproduct diagram iff A and BB are disjoint monos whose union is all of C; thus hom(1,−) preserves binary coproducts as soon as it preserves the initial object and binary unions. This leads to the following equivalent form of “locality” that makes sense even for elementary toposes:

Definition/Theorem 1.4. An elementary topos E is local if the terminal
object 1 is
  - nonempty: 1≇0
  - connected: 1=p∨q implies 1=p or 1=q and
  - projective: every epi U→1 admits a section t:1→U

Proposition 4.6. For ℰ a Grothendieck topos and X∈ℰ an object, the over topos ℰ/X is local if X is a tiny object.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/local+site
A site is called a local site if
  - it has a terminal object *;
  - the only covering family of * is the trivial cover.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+site
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+topos

A topos ℰ over some base topos 𝒮, i.e. equipped with a geometric morphism (f^*⊣f_*):ℰ⟶f_*←f^* 𝒮 is cohesive if it is a strongly connected topos and a local topos.

Classifying topos
-----------------

Si E est un topos avec un natural number object, on peut construire
E[U] le topos classifiant des objets; U est l'objet générique
et V objet de F <=> map F->E[U].
La construction s'étend pour avoir un topos classifiant d'une géométrie
algébrique finie et finiment présentée.

Note: si on a un topos de Grothendieck comme base, par ex Set, on peut
enlever 'fini' pour la théorie.

Theorem (Object classifiers).
Let S be a topos with an NNO and let BTop_S be the 2-category of bounded S-toposes. Then, the forgetful functor BTop_S → Cat is bicategorically represented by a bounded S-topos S[O]; in particular, it must send bicategorical colimits in BTop_S to bicategorical limits in Cat.
Proof. See Example 3.2.9 in [Johnstone, 2002a, Part B].

* Diaconescu theorem

Si f: F->E est géométrique, C catégorie interne à E, alors
[F, E^C]_E =~ {internal presheaves on f*C which are flat}

* Coherent logic
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherent+logic
∧ (and), ∨ (or), ⊤ (true), ⊥ (false), ∃ (existential quantifier).
- Every finitary first-order theory is equivalent, over classical logic, to a coherent theory
- every coherent topos has enough points (Deligne). In particular, this applies to the classifying toposes of coherent theories. It follows that models in Set are sufficient to detect provability in coherent logic [en particulier on peut raisonner comme en logique booléenne avec le LEM].
- Coherent logic also satisfies a definability theorem: if a relation can be constructed in every Set-model of a coherent theory T, in a natural way, then that relation is named by some coherent formula in T
- It follows that if a morphism of coherent theories (i.e. an interpretation of one coherent theory in another) induces an equivalence of their categories of models in Set, then it is a Morita equivalence of theories (i.e. induces an equivalence of classifying toposes, hence an equivalence of categories of models in all Grothendieck toposes).
Attention: The category of models of a coherent theory (in Set) is always an accessible category (this is true more generally for models of any logical theory). However, it need not be finitely accessible (i.e. ω-accessible).

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherent+topos
A coherent topos is a sheaf topos with a site of definition that is a coherent category with coherent coverage.
Theorem 2.1. Deligne completeness theorem
  Every coherent topos has enough points.
Examples: The classifying topos of a coherent theory is a coherent topos.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/classifying+topos

Exemple: si G groupe discret, G-Bund(X)=G-torsor in Sh(X)≃Topos(Sh(X),BG).
pour X espace topologique (ou localic)

$ 2. Definition
Every sheaf topos F is a completion S[T] of the syntactic category C_T of some geometric theory T: F≃S[T]
And structures of type T in E is what geometric morphisms E→F classify.

If C_T is the syntactic category of T, so that T-models are the same as geometric functors out of C_T, then this universal model can be identified with a certain geometric functor U:C_T→S[T].
Its universality property means that any geometric functor X:C_T→E factors essentially uniquely as X:C_T →U S[T] →f* E

More specifically, for any cartesian theory, regular theory or coherent theory 𝕋 (which in ascending order are special cases of each other and all of geometric theories), the corresponding syntactic category 𝒞_𝕋 comes equipped with the structure of a syntactic site (𝒞,𝕋,J) and the classifying topos for 𝕋 is the sheaf topos Sh(𝒞_𝕋,J).

$ 3. Background on the theory of theories
- Finite product theory = Lawrere theory = algebraic theory. 
  Classifying theory: C_fp[T] with finite products; models: product preserving functors C_fp[T]->E

- Finite limit theory = essentially algebraic theory = locally finitely presentable categories
  Classifying theory: C_fl[T] with finite limits; models: left-exact functors C_fp[T]->E

- Geometric theory
  Classifying theory: Grothendieck topos S[T]; models: geometric functors E->S[T]

Each type of theory may be considered a 22-theory, or doctrine. Furthermore, each type of theory can be promoted to a theory “further up the line”, by freely adding the missing structure to the classifying category. This can always be done purely formally, but in a few cases this promotion also has other, more explicit descriptions.

For instance, to go from a finite products theory T to the corresponding finite limits theory, we can take the opposite of the category of finitely presentable models of T in Set, thanks to Gabriel-Ulmer duality. Similarly, to go from a finite limits theory to the classifying topos of the corresponding geometric theory, we can take the category of presheaves on the classifying category of the finite limits theory.

$ 4.1 Geometric morphisms equivalent to morphisms of sites
Proposition 4.1. Let (𝒞,J) and (𝒟,K) be cartesian sites such that 𝒞 is a small category, 𝒟 is an essentially small category and the coverage K is subcanonical.
Then a geometric morphism of the corresponding sheaf toposes f:Sh(𝒟,K)→Sh(𝒞,J)
is induced by a morphism of sites (𝒟,K)←(𝒞,J)
precisely if the inverse image of f respects the Yoneda embeddings j as
𝒟       ←   𝒟
↓ j_𝒟       ↓ j_𝒞 
Sh(𝒟,K) ←f* Sh(𝒞,J).

Corollary 4.2. Let (𝒞,J) be a small cartesian site and let ℰ be any sheaf topos. Then we have an equivalence of categories
Topos(ℰ,Sh(𝒞,J))≃Site((𝒞,J),(ℰ,C))
between the geometric morphisms from ℰ to Sh(𝒞,J) and the morphisms of sites from (𝒞,J) to the big site (ℰ,C) for C the canonical coverage on ℰ.

Remark 4.3. This means that a sheaf topos Sh(𝒞,J) is the classifying topos for the theory of local algebras determined by the site (𝒞,J).

$ 5. Examples
- Object: The presheaf topos [FinSet, Set] on the opposite category of FinSet is the classifying topos for the theory of object, ie geometric morphism E->[FinSet,Set]= object of E
- Pointed objects: Similarly, the presheaf topos [FinSet*,Set] (where FinSet* is the category of finite pointed sets) classifies pointed object
- For groups: Si C(Gp) est la catégorie de Lawrere des groupes, alors les
  modèles dans Set est la catégorie des groupes, et on prend Cl(Gp) la
  sous-catégorie (small) des groupes finiment présentables. Alors Cl(Gp)
  est une extension de C(Gp) qui admet les limites finies; et le topos
  classifiant est sa catégorie de préfaisceaux.
- (inhabited) linear orders: The category of cosimplicial sets [Δ,Set] – hence the presheaf topos over the opposite category Δ^op of the simplex
  category – is the classifying topos for inhabited linear orders (ie x<y).
- Set^Δ^op, the category of simplicial sets, is the classifying topos for linear intervals =totally ordered set with distinct top and bottom elements
- The category of cyclic sets is the classifying topos for abstract circles 
- the classifying topos for local rings is the big Zariski topos of the scheme Spec(ℤ).
- For Spec R an affine scheme, the étale topos Sh(X_{et}) classifies “strict local R-algebras”. The points of this topos are strict Henselian R-algebras.

* For principal bundles:
Essentially every topos may be regarded as a classifying topos for certain torsors/principal bundles.
- Over bare groups:
For any (bare / discrete) group G, write BG for its delooping groupoid, the groupoid with a single object and G as its endomorphisms. The presheaf topos
GSet:=PSh(BG) is the classifying topos for G-torsors. Note: it is not hard
to describe a geometric theory whose models are G-torsors.
Th 5.2: There is a canonical geometric morphisms PSh(BG)→Sh(ℬG), where ℬG
is the classifying group in topological spaces. This is a weak homotopy equivalence of toposes, in that it induces isomorphisms on geometric homotopy groups of the terminal object.
- Over topological groups:
If G is a general topological group we have a simplicial topological space G^×•. The category Sh(G^×•) of sheaves on this simplicial space is a topos which classify G-principal bundles.
- For general localic groupoids: any Grothendieck topos can be thought of as a classifying topos for some localic groupoid
- For flat functors. As a special case of the above, any presheaf topos,
  i.e. any topos of the form Set^C^op, is the classifying topos for flat
  functors from C. This is Diaconescu's theorem. If CC has finite limits,
  then a flat functor C→E is the same as a functor that preserves finite
  limits.
- For geometric theories / cover-preserving flat functors on a site:
  Proposition 5.3. Every sheaf topos has a cartesian site (𝒞,J)
This Sh(𝒞,J) is the classifying topos for cover-preserving flat functors out of 𝒞. Every category of such functors is the category of models of some geometric theory, and for every geometric theory there is such a cartesian site.
- For local algebras
As a special case or rather re-interpretation of the above, let 𝒯 be any essentially algebraic theory and equip its syntactic category 𝒞_𝕋 with some coverage J. Then the sheaf topos Sh(𝒞_𝕋,J) is the classifying topos for local 𝕋-algebras:
for Sh(X) any sheaf topos a geometric morphism 𝒪:Sh(X)→Sh(𝒞_𝕋,J)
is a 𝕋-algebra in Sh(X), hence a sheaf of 𝕋-algebras over the site X; such that this sheaf of algebras is local as seen by the respective topologies.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+theory
- A geometric theory is a (possibly infinitary) first order theory whose models are preserved and reflected by geometric morphisms.
- A geometric theory is a (possibly infinitary) first order theory whose axioms can be written as sequents in context of formulae constructed from the connectives ⊤ (truth), ∧ (finite conjunction), ⊥ (falsity), ⋁ (possibly infinitary disjunction), and ∃ (existential quantification), as well as == (equality).
- A geometric theory is a syntactic description of a Grothendieck topos.

$ Logical definition
- Since ∧ and ⊤ are represented by intersections and identities (top elements), and == is represented by equalizer, these can be interpreted in any lex category. Theories involving only these are examples of cartesian theories.
- Since ∃ is represented by the image of a subobject, it can be interpreted in any regular category. Theories involving only ∧, ⊤, and ∃s are regular theories.
- Since ∨ and ⊥ are represented by union and bottom elements, these can be interpreted in any coherent category. Theories which add these to regular logic are called coherent theories.
- Finally, theories which also involve infinitary ⋁, which is again represented by an infinitary union, can be interpreted in infinitary coherent categories, aka geometric categories. These are geometric theories.

Axioms: φ ⊢_x ψ, ie ∀x.(φ⇒ψ)

$ Examples
- Any finitary algebraic theory is, in particular, a cartesian theory, and hence geometric. This includes monoids, groups, abelian groups, rings, commutative rings, etc.
- The theory of (strict) categories is not finitary-algebraic, but it is cartesian, and hence geometric; this generalises to (finitary) essentially algebraic theories.
- The theory of torsion-free abelian groups is also cartesian, being obtained from the theory of abelian groups by the addition of the sequents (n⋅x=0)⊢_x (x=0) for all n∈ℕ.
- The theory of local rings is a coherent theory
- The theory of fields is also coherent
- The theory of torsion abelian groups is geometric but not coherent
- The theory of a real number is geometric.
  The classifying topos of this theory is the topos of sheaves on the real numbers.
- The theory of a set isomorphic to ℕ is geometric
- The theory of flat diagrams over a small category 𝒞 is geometric.
  This theory is classified by the topos of presheaves over 𝒞
  It is commonly more useful to consider the theory of flat presheaves over 𝒞, in other words the flat diagrams over 𝒞^op}. (Elephant calls these torsors over 𝒞, generalizing the established terminology for groups.) This is because the representable presheaves are flat, and so Yoneda’s lemma transforms objects of 𝒞 covariantly into models of the theory. In fact, the models of the theory are the filtered colimits of representables. For example, a finitary algebraic theory is classified by the topos of covariant functors from the category of finitely presented algebras to Set.

$ In terms of sheaf topoi

Categories of each “logical” type can also be “completed” with respect to a suitable “exactness” property, without changing their internal logic. Any regular category has an completion into an exact category (see regular and exact completion), any coherent category has a completion into a pretopos, and any geometric category has a completion into an infinitary pretopos.

However, Giraud's theorem says that an infinitary pretopos having a generating set is precisely a Grothendieck topos. Moreover, a functor between Grothendieck topoi is geometric (preserves all the structure of a geometric category) iff it preserves finite limits and small colimits. By the adjoint functor theorem, this implies that it is the inverse image part of a geometric morphism, i.e. an adjunction f^*⊣f_* in which f^* (the “inverse image”) preserves finite limits.

Thus: Grothendieck topoi and inverse-image functors are in some sense the “natural home” for models of geometric theories.

In particular, we can apply the “exact completion” operation to the syntactic category G_T of a geometric theory to obtain an infinitary pretopos Set[T]. As long as the theory T was itself small, Set[T] will have a generating set, and therefore will be a Grothendieck topos. The universal property of the syntactic category, combined with that of the exact completion, implies that for any Grothendieck topos E, geometric morphisms E→Set[T] are equivalent to T-models in E. This topos Set[T] is called the classifying topos of T.

In the other direction, if C is any small site, we can write down a “geometric theory of cover-preserving flat functors C^op→Set.” By Diaconescu's theorem classifying geometric morphisms into sheaf topoi, it follows that Sh(C) is a classifying topos for this theory.

Barr's theorem says, that if a statement in geometric logic is deducible from a geometric theory using classical logic and the axiom of choice, then it is also
deducible from it in constructive mathematics.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Barr%27s+theorem

Barr’s theorem was originally conjectured by William Lawvere as an infinitary generalization of the Deligne completeness theorem for coherent toposes which can be expressed as the existence of a surjection 𝒮/K→ℰ for a coherent topos ℰ with set of points K. General toposes ℰ may fail to have enough points but Michael Barr showed that a surjection from a suitable Boolean topos still exists.
As surjections permit the transfer of logical properties, Barr’s theorem has the following important consequence:
"If a statement in geometric logic is deducible from a geometric theory using classical logic and the axiom of choice, then it is also deducible from it in constructive mathematic"

Theorem 2.1. If ℰ is a Grothendieck topos, then there is a surjective geometric morphism ℱ→ℰ where ℱ satisfies the axiom of choice.

Deligne's completeness theorem says that a coherent Grothendieck topos has enough points in Set and this corresponds to the Gödel-Henkin completeness theorem for first-order theories. Similarly, Barr’s theorem can interpreted as saying that a Grothendieck topos has sufficient Boolean-valued points and is in turn closely related to Mansfield’s Boolean-valued completeness theorem for infinitary first-order theories.

=> Ainsi une théorie géométrique démontrable en logique classique est vraie
en logique booléenne.
=> Pour une théorie cohérente, comme every Grothendieck topos with enough points is equivalent to the classifying topos of a topological groupoid, on a un modèle universel topologique. On peut le construire explicitement, cf 'Moerdijk, Classyfing space for topos with enough points'.
 Conséquence: a finitary geometric theory 𝕋 has models in Set and the provability of a sequent in coherent logic relative to 𝕋 is equivalent to its validity in all set-theoretical models of 𝕋. En effet son topos classifiant est cohérent, et il a assez de points.

*https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+algebra-ed+topos

Let 𝒞_𝕋 be the syntactic category of an essentially algebraic theory 𝕋, hence any category with finite limits. Let J be a subcanonical coverage on 𝒞_𝕋.
Then the sheaf topos Sh(𝒞_𝕋,J) is the classifying topos for the geometric theory of 𝕋-local algebras. Indeed a geometric morphism corresponds to a functor
𝒪_X:𝒞_𝕋→ℰ such that
  - it preserves finite limits (and hence produces a 𝕋-algebra in ℰ;
  - it sends J-coverings to epimorphisms; which makes it a local 𝕋-algebra.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+ringed+topos

A ringed topos (X,𝒪_X) with enough points (such as the sheaf topos over a topological space) is a locally ringed topos if all stalks 𝒪_X(x) are local rings.

This is a geometric theory:
(0=1)⊢false; x+y=1⊢∃_z (xz=1) ∨ ∃_z (yz=1)


Espace classifiant d'un groupoide continu
-----------------------------------------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/classifying+topos+of+a+localic+groupoid

Let N•𝒢:Δ^op→Locales be the simplicial object in locales given by the nerve of 𝒢. By applying the sheaf topos functor Sh:Locale→Topos to this, we obtain a simplicial topos Sh(N𝒢):[n]↦Sh(N_n𝒢). Let tr_2 Sh(N𝒢) be its 2-truncation, then the 2-colimit Sh(𝒢)≔lim⟶ n tr_2 Sh(N•𝒢) in the 2-category Topos is called the classifying topos of 𝒢.

Explicitely: For E∈Sh(𝒢_0) a sheaf on the topological space of its objects, say that a 𝒢_1-action on E is a continuous groupoid action of 𝒢• on the etale space Sp(E)→𝒢_00 over 𝒢_0 that corresponds to the sheaf E, hence for each morphisms f:x→y a continuous function ρ(f):Sp(E)_x→Sp(E)_y that satisfies the usual action property. These sheaves with 𝒢_1-action and with the evident homomorphisms between them form a category, and this is Sh(𝒢).

- Proposition (Joyal-Tierney 84)
For every Grothendieck topos ℰ there is a localic groupoid 𝒢 such that ℰ≃Sh(𝒢)

- Proposition (Moerdijk 88, theorem 5)
This construction extends to an equivalence of 2-categories between that of Grothendieck toposes Topos and a localization of that of localic groupoids.

- Proposition (Butz-Moerdijk 98) If ℰ has enough points, then there exists in fact a topological groupoid 𝒢 such that ℰ≃Sh(𝒢).

** Externalisation of an internal category

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/small+fibration
A fibered category is a small fibration if it is equivalent to a fibered category which is obtained via a specific construction of the externalization of an internal category.
-> fibered category P:F→E, whose fiber over an object I (“index set”) in C is the small category C^I=hom_E(I,C) whose object part is C_0^I and morphism part is C_1^I; and the structure maps of C^I are obtained by postcomposing with structure maps of C.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+site#externalization

Definition 3.1. Let 𝒞 be a small category and let ℰ:=[𝒞^op,Set] be its presheaf topos. Let 𝔻∈ℰ be an internal site. Regarded, by the Yoneda lemma, as a functor 𝔻:𝒞^op→Cat, this induces via the Grothendieck construction a fibered category which we denote 𝒞⋊𝔻→𝒞.

Example 3.2. Let G be a group (in Set, hence a discrete group) and let 𝒞:=BG be its delooping groupoid. Then
ℰ≃[BG,Set] is the topos of permutation representations of G. Let H∈ℰ be a group object. This is equivalently a group in Set equipped with a G-action. Its internal delooping gives the internal groupoid 𝔻:=ℬH in ℰ.
In this case we have that 𝒞⋊𝔻≃B(G⋊H) is the delooping groupoid of the semidirect product group of the G-action on H.

Proposition 3.4. We have an equivalence of categories
[𝔻^op,[𝒞^op,Set]]≃[(𝒞⋊𝔻)^op,Set] between the category of internal presheaves in ℰ over the internal category 𝔻, and external presheaves over the semidirect product site 𝒞⋊𝔻.

Proposition 3.6. Let ℰ=Sh_J(𝒞) be a sheaf topos and (𝔻,K) an internal site in ℰ. Then with def. 3.5 we have an equivalence of categories
Sh_K(𝔻)≃Sh_J⋊K(𝒞⋊𝔻) between internal sheaves in ℰ on 𝔻 and external sheaves on the semidirect product site J⋊K.
Moreover, the projection functor P:𝒞⋊𝔻 is cover-reflecting and induces a geometric morphism Γ:Sh_K(𝔻)→ℰ.

Stacks and topos
----------------

** Internal groupoids and stacks

* https://mathoverflow.net/questions/93948/link-between-internal-groupoids-and-stacks-on-a-topos
The 2-category of internal groupoids in Sh(C,J) is equivalent to the 2-category of sheaves of groupoids on (C,J). To see this, given a groupoid G in sheaves,the strict 2-functor C↦(G0(C)⇉G1(C)) is a sheaf of groupoids. So, there is a 2-functor
  F: Gpd(Sh(C,J)) → Sh_J(C,Gpd) → St(C,J)
which sends G↦a((G0(⋅)⇉G1(⋅)), where a is the stackification 2-functor.

I claim that a is essentially surjective. Indeed, by the Grothendieck construction, one can see easily that every stack is equivalent to a strict 2-functor from C^op into the 2-category Gpd of groupoids. Such a strict 2-functor, is the same as a functor into the 1-category of groupoids, which is the same as a groupoid object in presheaves (by the same argument). One can sheafify this into a sheaf of groupoids, and then apply F to it, and the result is equivalent to the starting stack.

The fact fact that stacks are equivalent to groupoids in sheaves up to "weak categorical equivalence" can be found in (I believe) in Bunge's Stack completions and Morita equivalence for categories in a topos, but can also be proven directly by examining F.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+category#InATopos
If the ambient category is a topos, then with the right kind of notion of internal functor, the internal groupoids form the corresponding (2,1)-topos of groupoid-valued stacks and the internal categories form the corresponding 2-topos of category-valued stacks/2-sheaves.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-topos#InTermsOfInternalCategories
Given a 2-topos 𝒳, regard it is a 2-site by equipping it with its canonical topology.
A 2-sheaf 2-topos is “(n,r)-localic” if it has an (n,r)-site of definition.

Definition 2.1. Write Cat(𝒳) for the 2-category of internal categories in 𝒳, precisely: the 2-category of 2-congruences and internal anafunctors between them.

Theorem 2.2. For 𝒳 a 2-topos, there is an equivalence of 2-categories 𝒳≃Cat(𝒳).
- If 𝒳 is (2,1)-localic, with a (2,1)-site of definition C, then there is already an equivalence 𝒳≃Cat(Sh_(2,1)(C))
with the 2-category of categories internal to the underlying (2,1)-topos.
- If 𝒳 is 1-localic, with 1-site of definition, then there is even already an equivalence 𝒳≃Cat(Sh(C)) with the internal categories in the underlying sheaf topos.

Proof. By the 2-Giraud theorem, 𝒳 is an exact 2-category. With this, the first statement is this theorem at 2-congruence.
By the discussion at n-localic 2-topos, a 2-sheaf 2-topos has enough groupoids precisely if it has a (2,1)-site of definition, and has enough discretes precisely if it has a 1-site of definition. With this the second and third statement is this theorem at 2-congruence.  ▮

Remark 2.3. The noteworthy point about theorem 2.2 is that for an ambient context which is a (2,1)-localic (2,1)-topos, the straightforward morphisms of internal categories, hence the notion of internal functors, needs no further localization. This is in stark contrast to the situation for an ambient 1-category. The generalization of this phenomenon is discussed at category object in an (∞,1)-category.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-sheaf
Proposition 3.1. If C is a topos and E is a C-topos, then (the indexed category corresponding to) E is a 2-sheaf on C with respect to the canonical topology.
Moreover, over a 1-site the 2-topos of 2-sheaves ought to be equivalent to the (suitably defined) 2-category of internal categories in the underlying 1-topos.
Over a (2,1)-site the 2-topos of 2-sheaves ought to be equivalent to the 2-category of internal (infinity,1)-categories in the corresponding (2,1)-topos.

Galois
------

- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Galois+theory#GaloisInTopos
- https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck's+Galois+theory

Let C be a category and F:C→Set a functor.
G0) The full subcategory of ∫_F C on the finite objects [X finite if F(X)
finite set] is cofinal.
G1) C has all finite limits
G2) C has an initial object, finite coproducts and quotients by finite groups
G3) Given f:x→z in C there is a factorisation x →e y →i z where e is a strict epimorphism and i is a mono. Also, y is assumed to be a direct summand of z.
G4) F preserves finite limits
G5) F preserves initial object, finite sums, quotients by finite group actions and sends strict epimorphisms to surjections
G6) F reflects isomorphisms

The functor F is called the fibre functor, and the pair (C,F) is sometimes called a Galois category.
It follows from the axioms that F is a pro-representable functor. The automorphism group of the pro-object P representing F is (should be. I’m not familiar enough with pro-objects) a profinite group π. This acts on F(X)=[P,−] by precomposition (talking out of my depth here – it’s getting a bit vague) and so F lifts to a functor to π−Set, and Grothendieck’s result is that this functor is an equivalence of categories.
There are several modifications one can make the above. In the case that C is the category of covering spaces of a nice enough space, the functor F is representable by the universal covering space, and so there is a ‘representable’ version of the above, not needing to utilise profinite groups. One can also consider just the connected-objects version, and end up with an equivalence to the category of transitive π-sets.

Résumé: Groupoids, Stacks and Galois
------------------------------------

### Stacks

Déf: si S est une catégorie régulière, une fibration A/S est un stack si
pour tout f:J->>I, A^I =~ Des(f).
Reformulation: f induit une équivalence faible entre les catégories internes 
J_f = J x_I J => J et I, et A/S stack si le foncteur induit A^f: A^I ->
A^J_f est une équivalence.

Exemple: si S, S' régulières, F:S->S' un foncteur exact, et S' finitely
complete exact, alors S'/S est un stack (S-indexée par I->S'/F(I))

Th: A fibration A/S is a stack iff for every weak equivalence functor F:B->C in S, A^F: A^C->A^B is an equivalence of fibration.
Corollaire: si F:A->B est une weak equivalence et B est un stack, alors B
est la stack complétion.

* Si S est un topos, alors:
- Si A/S est une fibration localement small, sa stack complétion est donnée par
Yoneda: A -> préfaisceaux loc. représentables dans S^A°
Def: an object I-indexed X of (S^A°)^I is locally representable if there exists
f:K->>I and x \in A^K tel que Yon^K(x)=~f*X.

- Si G est un groupe ou un groupoïde dans S, alors sa stack complétion est donnée par les right-G-torsors dans S. En effet, S^G° =~ BG, et les G-torseurs
correspondent aux éléments localement représentables.
Si S a la ASC (un groupoid G a une internal stack complétion Gtilde), alors
Hom_S(Gtilde, Htilde) =~ Top_S(BG, BH).

* Si f:E->S est un topos, Pointess_S(E) est un stack pour la topologie
canonique de S. Pointess_S(E)^I={morphismes loc. connexes S/I->E au dessus
de S}.
- Tout point essentiel f:S/I->E est indexed-représentable: il
existe X dans E/f*I tel que f*: E->S/I est donné par
f*(Y)=Hom_{E/f*I}(X->f*I, Y x f*I -> f*I).
- Si C est une catégorie interne de S, sa stack complétion donnée par Yoneda
plus haut se reformule comme les points de Pointess_S(S^C°) qui sont
localement représentables.

Plus exactement tel qu'on ait le diagramme:
φ: S/I -> S^C°
   S/K -> S/C0
où K->>I et K->C0 rendent X->Delta I loc représentable.
Ainsi un point S-essentiel est loc représentable si il vient d'un tel
diagramme, où S/K->S/C0->S^C° se voit comme un point représentable.

- De plus dans ce cas Pointess_S(S^C°) =~ S-atomic points de S^C°
  = locally the retract of representables
  et la Karoubian completion de C est donnée par les retract of representables dans S^C°,
  et donc Pointess_S(S^C°) est la stack complétion de la Karoubian completion de C.
- Donc si G est un groupoïde (discret) dans S, sa stack complétion est
  Pointess_S(BG) = Point_S(BG) =~ G-torsors =~ LocRep(S^G°) [Rappel: S^G° =~ BG]

### Locales:

Déf: f:X->Y est étale si on a un recouvrement ouvert de X par des U_i tels que
f:U_i->f(U_i) est un iso; c'est équivalent à f et Δ_f: X->X x_Y X sont
ouverts. Sh(X) =~ espaces étales sur X.

* Localic reflection:
Si f:F->E, on a une adjonction f_! -| f^# entre les espaces internes à F et
les espaces internes à E; O(f_! Y)=f_* OY.
Par la hyperconnected localic-factorisation, on a une réflexion de f vers
un morphisme localic Sh(X)->E où X est une locale interne à E. Cette
réflexion est stable par pullback et produit, et préserve et reflète les
limites.

### Groupoides localic:

Rappel des définitions: un groupoid est donné par G_1=>G_0 avec d0 et d1
les domain/codomain map, une unit map s:G0->G1 et une multiplication
m: G_1 x_G0 G_1 -> G_1. L'existence d'un inverse i:G1->G1 peut s'écrire
comme le fait que (m,\pi_2) et (\pi_1, m): G1 x_G0 G1 -> G1 x_G0 G1
sont des isomorphismes au dessus de G1.

* Si G est un groupoid localic continu, on peut construire BG comme
1) la colimite du topos simplicial Sh(NG)=N Sh(G);
  ou encore comme le topos de descente donné par la colimite
  Sh(G_1 x_G0 G_1) ≡> Sh(G_1) => Sh(G_0) ->> BG
  du simplexe tronqué.
  Note: Sh(G_0)->BG est une surjection ouverte si G est ouvert, donc BG est
  aussi BGhat où Ghat est le groupoid associé à ce morphisme de descente
  [=étale complétion de G].

2) l'espace des G-actions étales (si G ouvert) ie les faisceaux munis d'une
  G-action.
  A G-space est un espace p:E->G0 muni d'une action E x_G0 G1 -> E qui
  satisfait les conditions usuelles;
  En logique interne: pour tout h:z->y et g:y->x dans G1, et e \in
  p^{-1}(x), alors p(e.g)=y, e.s(x)=e, (e.g).h=e.(goh).
  BG: G-space p:E->G0 où p étale.

* Stabilité: Si p:F->E, et G groupoide continu dans E, B(F,p^# G)=F x_E B(E,G)

  Corollaire (Localisation): Si E est un G-space, E x_G0 G1 => E définit un groupoide E_G, et
  G-space/E =~ E_G-space, et la bijection est stable par pullback.
  En se restreignant aux espaces étales: BG/E =~ B E_G, bijection stable
  par pullback.

* Equivalences:
- (Etale complete groupoid, weak equiv^{-1})->(Top, isomorphic class of geom morphism) est une équivalence de 1-catégorie.
- The bicategory of continuous groupoids and complete flat bispaces is equivalent to the dual of the bicategory of toposes and geometric morphisms.

* Classification: si G groupoid localic ouvert continu, BG classifie les Ghat principal bundle, où Ghat est sa complétion étale.

Si on note + les morphismes qui respectent le "bag of points" Sh(G0)->G, alors
Hom(G,H) =~ Top[BH, BG]+ (G, H groupoides ouvert, G étale complète). (le []
signifie que l'on considère Top comme une 2-1 catégorie ici).

### Stacks and topos

Pour la topologie des surjections ouvertes de la catégorie Space des espaces (localic)
  - Space indexée sur elle-même est un stack
  - SPoints(E)={Sh(X)->E où X spatial}=Space/E est un stack pour un topos E.

Si G est un groupoid ouvert,
  - Si E est un topos, SPoints(E)^G =~ Top(BG,E)
  - la catégorie Space^G° des right G-space [=G-bundle] (ie T->X, où T est muni
    d'une G-action à droite compatible avec la projection vers X) est un
    stack
  - La stack complétion de [G] (externalisation de G) est donné par les
    G-torseurs (ie les G-bundle principaux) qui sont exactement les
    éléments localement représentables dans Space^G°.
  - [Ghat] =~ SPoints(BG)+ [où on voit un espace X comme un groupoid trivial]
    où Ghat est la complétion étale de G.
  - Tor(Ghat) =~ SPoints(BG) (car ce sont deux stack complétions de [Ghat])
    d'où Tor(X, Ghat)=~Top(Sh(X), BG),
    et donc Tor(Ghat)^H=Top[BH, BG] où Tor(Ghat)^H est la catégorie des
    H-Ghat bispaces.

Theorem C (Bunge 1990): For an étale complète groupoid G which is not empty
and connected, LocRep(S^G°)=~Tors(G)=~Points(S^G°).

### Descente:

- Si E. est un topos simplicial alors sa colimite est un topos équivalent
  aux données de descente Des(E.) le cocone de descente universel:
  Concrètement Des(E_.) est la catégorie des objets (X,f) de E_0, avec f un
  isomorphisme d_1*(X) =~ d_2*(X) tel que s*(f)=Id et d_0*(f) o
  d_2*(f)=d_1*(f), autrement dit c'est la colimite E_2 ≡> E_1 => E_0 -> Desc(E).

- Localisation lemma: si (X,f) \in Des(E_.), alors Desc(E_./(X,f))=Desc(E_.)/(X,f).

* Joyal-Tierney: 
  1) un morphisme ouvert surjectif est de descente effective
  2) tout topos E admet une map T->E connected loc. connected (donc open surjectif) depuis un espace (localic).
  3) Si f:T->E est de descente effective, E=BG où G est le groupoid T x_E T => T
     Si T localic et f ouverte surjective, G est un groupoid localic ouvert étale complete. Si f connected loc. connected, G l'est aussi, et si E->S est ouvert on peut prendre G0 ouvert.

### Galois

G progroupe strict <=> G groupe localic prodiscret (<=> the open normal subgroups form a neighboorhood of e:1->G.)
BG =~ lim_proj BG_i.

Soit E loc. connected au-dessus de S.
Si U->>1, dans le pushout
  E/U -> E
  S/e!_U -> GG_U
π_U:E->GG_U identifie π_U^-1 GG_U comme les objets loc. constants U-splits
de E. 
GG_U est donc un topos Galoisien atomic simplement connexe; GG_U=BG_U
où G_U étale complète discrete et p_U:S/e_!U ->GG_U s'identifie avec le bag
of points S[G0:=e_! U]->G_U. Explicitement on peut construire
G_U comme le groupoide des points, le localic groupoid des points, ou
encore Aut(p_U).

Si K est un groupe, Hom(G_U, K) =~ Top_S(BG_U, BK)+ =~ Tors(E,K)^U={les U-splits K-torsors dans E}
d'où H^1(E,K)^U = π_0(Hom(G_U, K)).

La limite filtrante des GG_U donne un topos ∏^c_1(E) égal aux objets loc.
constants de E. On a E->∏^c_1(E) connected locally connected, et ∏^c_1(E)
est un topos Galoisien. Il est représenté par un groupoid localic
prodiscrete π^c_1(E)
qui représente H^1(E,-) avec coefficient dans des groupes discrets (qui
sont des stacks).

Si G est prodiscret, [E, BG] =~  [∏^c_1, BG] =~ [π^1_E, G].

Theorem 4.10 (Bunge): E/S loc. connected bounded, S has ASC. (<=>)
- E/S est Galois (ie les objets galoisiens donnent un site de définition de E)
- E =~ \Pi_1^c(E)
- E est générée par les loc. constant covers (ie les objets loc constants forment un site de définition, en fait on aura même que tout objet est union d'objets loc constants)
- E=BG pour G prodiscrete localic groupoid.

(En particulier un topos Galoisien a toujours assez de points si G0 discrete.
Cf Moerdijk: E/S Galois pointed connected 
<=> E pointed connected loc. connected généré par les loc. trivial covers
<=> E=BG pour un groupe localic G prodiscrete)

Corollaire 4.11: E/S loc. connected bounded. (<=>)
- E/S loc simply connected et Galois
- E =~ \Pi_1^c(E) et E loc simply connected
- E=E_lc la sous catégorie des loc. constant objects
- E=BG pour G discrete localic groupoid.

* Multigalois
Definition 4.2.1. A Multigalois topos is a locally connected topos generated by its Galois objects, or, equivalently, it is a sum of Galois topoi.

Theorem 4.2.2 (discrete case) (<=>)
2. E is a locally simply-connected (Galois) Multigalois topos.
3. E is (connected) atomic with enough essential points.
4. The canonical geometric morphism μ:B(G)→E is an equivalence, where G is the (connected) discrete groupoid of points G = Points(E).
5. E is the classifying topos of any (connected) discrete groupoid

Theorem 4.2.3 (pointed prodiscrete case). (<=>)
1. E has enough points and it is (connected) generated by its locally constant objects.
2. E has enough points and it is a (Galois) Multigalois topos.
3. E is (connected) atomic with enough proessential points.
4. The canonical geometric morphism B(G) -μ→ E is an equivalence, where G is the (connected) localic groupoid of points G = lPoints(E), which in this case has prodiscrete “hom-spaces”.
5. E is the classifying topos of any (connected) localic groupoid with discrete space of objects and prodiscrete “hom-spaces”.

Theorem 4.2.4 (unpointed prodiscrete case). (<=>)
1. E is (connected) generated by its locally constant objects.
2. E is a (Galois) Multigalois topos.
4. The canonical geometric morphism B(G) μ−→ E is an equivalence, where G is the (connected) localic groupoid of phantom points G = phPoints(E), which is prodiscrete (by definition).
5. E is the classifying topos of any (connected) prodiscrete localic groupoid

Theorem 4.2.5 (pointed localic case). (<=>)
3. E is (connected) atomic with enough points.
4. The canonical geometric morphism B(G) μ−→ E is an equivalence, where G is the (connected) localic groupoid of points G = lPoints(E).
5. E is the classifying topos of any (connected) localic groupoid with discrete space of object.

### Fundamental path groupoid

Si E/S bounded, on a une notion de path fundamental group topos ∏_1^p(E),
défini comme la colimitte du diagramme de descente E^Δ ≡> E^I => E où I est
l'intervalle unité et Δ le 2-simplexe.

Si L est loc constant, il a le unique path lifting, donc ∏_1^p(E)/φ*(L) =~ ∏_1^p(E/L).

Si E locally connected, on a un morphisme ∏_1^p(E)->∏_1^c(E) (au-dessous de E).
C'est une équivalence si E est S-Galoisien.

Th: Si E loc connected et loc simply path connected, alors on a une équivalence ∏_1^p(E)->∏_1^c(E) 

Note: loc simply path connected =
i) loc simply connected (ce qui implique que si A est le cover universel, ∏_1^c(E/A)=S/e_!A; note que E/A -> E se voit comme le cover universel)
ii) on a l'équivalence \Pi_1^p(E/A)=S/e_!A.

Prop: E est locally path simply connected si E a un système générateur d'objets
connectés C_i tels que E/C_i p.s.c., ie E^Δ2 -> E^δΔ2 est une surjection
stable.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stabilization+hypothesis
an (m+2)-tuply monoidal (m,n)(m,n)-category is maximally monoidal.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/delooping+hypothesis

k-tuply monoidal n-categories can be identified with (k−j)-tuply monoidal, (j-1)-simply connected (n+j)-categories, for any 0≤j≤k.
=> k=j: k-tuply monoidal n-categories can be identified with pointed (k−1)-connected (n+k)-categories.

Here j-(simply) connected means that any two parallel i-morphisms are equivalent for i≤j. Also, 0-tuply monoidal is interpreted as meaning pointed.

The identification involves a degree shift: the i-morphisms of a k-tuply monoidal n-category become (i+j)-morphisms in the associated (k−j)-tuply monoidal (n+j)-category.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/k-tuply+monoidal+n-category

A k-tuply monoidal n-category is an n-category in which objects can be multiplied in k different ways, all of which interchange with each other up to equivalence. By the Eckmann-Hilton argument, this implies that these k ways all end up being equivalent, but that the single resulting operation is more and more commutative as k increases. The stabilization hypothesis states that by the time we reach k=n+2, the multiplication has become “maximally commutative.”

- 1-tuply monoidal n-category may be called simply a monoidal n-category
- A doubly monoidal n-category is a braided monoidal n-category
- A symmetric monoidal n-category is an k-tuply monoidal n-category for k≥n+2

Strings
-------

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram

The idea is to represent structures of dimension d by structures of dimension 2-d, using the Poincaré duality. Thus,
- an object is represented by a portion of plane,
- a 1-cell f:A\to B is represented by a vertical segment — called a string — separating the plane in two (the left part corresponding to A and the right one to B),
- a 2-cell \alpha:f\Rightarrow g:A\to B is represented by an intersection of strings (the strings corresponding to f above the link, the strings corresponding to g below the link).

Rem: Monoidal categories can also be pictured this way since a strict monoidal category can be seen as a 2-category with only one object (there will therefore be only one type of plane) and Mac Lane's strictness theorem states that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. 
[Pour Mac Lane's strictness theorem, cf
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+category]

En effet, si C est une cat monoïdale, on forme une 2-catégorie en prenant
pour 0-obj un unique objet; pour 1-objet les objets de C, avec la
composition donnée par le produit tensoriel, et pour 2-objets les
morphismes de C.

On obtient donc:
* http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+diagram
  String diagrams are a graphical calculus for expressing operations in a monoidal category. The idea is roughly to think of objects in a monoidal category as “strings” and a morphism from one tensor product to another as a node which the source strings enter and the target strings exit. Further structure on the monoidal category is encoded in geometrical properties on these strings. For instance
  - putting strings next to each other denotes the monoidal product, and having no string at all denotes the unit;
  - braiding strings over each other corresponds to – yes, the braiding (if any);
  - bending strings around corresponds to dualities on dualizable objects (if any).

Functors
--------

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lax+morphism
a lax morphism f:A→B is one which “preserves” the algebraic structure only up to a not-necessarily invertible transformation
Let T be a 2-monad on a 2-category K, and let A and B be (strict, pseudo, or ever lax or colax) T-algebras. A lax T-morphism f:A→B is a morphism in K
together with a 2-cell
 TA →Tf TB 
a↓   ⇙  ↓ b 
 A →f   B
Ex: - A lax monoidal functor is a lax morphism for the 2-monad on Cat whose algebras are monoidal categories. Similarly, an oplax monoidal functor is a colax morphism for this 2-monad.
- A lax functor between 2-categories is a lax morphism for the 2-monad on Cat-graphs whose algebras are 2-categories.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+functor

Lax monoidal functors send monoids to monoid

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lax+functor
  https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pseudofunctor
A lax functor or lax n-functor is a morphism of n-categories that is allowed to have structural cells – compositors, associators, etc – that need not be invertible (not even weakly).
This is to distinguish from pseudofunctor for which all these cells are required to be equivalences.

∞-categories
============

* ∞-categories
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/02/intrinsic_naturalness.html
- All this is clarified now. Now with HTT an entirely intrinsic, abstract, pure higher category theory definition of ∞-stack has been given: a Grothendieck (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks is a reflective ∞-subcategory of an (∞,1)-presheaf category
Sh_(∞,1)(C)↪←lex PSh_(∞,1)(C).
Every abstractly defined ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos Sh (∞,1)(C) has a generators-and-relation presentation by simplicial presheaves on C, and every such presentation presents an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos

- In every (∞,1)-category C with a 0-object, there are two god- given operations: the formation of loop space objects and that of suspension objects
Ω:C→≃←C:Σ.
These are nothing but the pullback and pushforward along itself of the inclusion of the zero object into any other object. An (∞,1)-category is stable if it is stable under these operations: if Ω and Σ exhibit an auto-equivalence.
Decatégorifier => triangulated category

- The simple central idea is that a concrete generalized space is an (∞,1)-topos equipped with a structure sheaf 𝒪, modeled as an ∞-stack-valued ∞-copreshaef on the ∞-category 𝒢 of spaces on which the geometry is modeled
𝒪:𝒢→Sh_(∞,1)(X).
And as shown there, by making concrete choices for that category of test spaces and then turning the crank, the abstract formalism spits out first standard algebraic geoemtry, then algebraic stack theory, then differential geometry, then derived differential geometry, derived E_∞-spectral geometry and everything else.

  - (open geometric morphisms) and C3.3 (locally connected geometric morphisms) are steps n=−1 and n=0 on an infinite ladder of locally n-connected geometric morphisms. A geometric morphism between (n+1,1)-toposes is locally nn-connected if its inverse image functor is locally cartesian closed and has a left adjoint

Theorem [Δ^op,Set] is the classifying topos for intervals in Set-toposes.
The closed unit interval [0,1] is sequential and is in fact an interval (a totally ordered object with distinct top and bottom elements). Thus it corresponds to a geometric morphism ℰ→[Δ op,Set] (an adjunction (f^⋆⊣f_⋆) with f^⋆ left-exact). [E=topological topos]
Theorem If S∈[Δ op,Set] is a simplicial set, then f^⋆(S) is its geometric realization, considered as a sequential space and hence as an object of ℰ. If X∈ℰ is a sequential space, then f_⋆(E) is its singular complex.

  I prefer to distinguish between the internal type theory of a category and the internal logic which sits on top of that type theory. The type theory is about constructing objects, while the logic is about constructing subobjects. For instance, limits and colimits, exponentials, and object classifiers belong to the type theory, while images, dual images, intersections, unions, and subobject classifiers belong to the logic.

# Topologie et Homotopy

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Homotopy+Theory
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Stable+Homotopy+Theory

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nerve
Definition 3.2. For 𝒞 a small category, def. 3.1, its simplicial nerve N(𝒞)• is the simplicial set with N(𝒞)_n≔𝒞_1 ×^{𝒞_0^n} the set of sequences of composable morphisms of length n.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+category
A model category (sometimes called a Quillen model category or a closed model category, but not related to “closed category”) is a context for doing homotopy theory. Quillen developed the definition of a model category to formalize the similarities between homotopy theory and homological algebra: the key examples which motivated his definition were the category of topological spaces, the category of simplicial sets, and the category of chain complexes.
So, what is a model category? For starters, it is a category equipped with three classes of morphisms, each closed under composition and called weak equivalences, fibrations and cofibrations

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Dold-Kan+correspondence
The Dold–Kan correspondence asserts there is an equivalence of categories between abelian simplicial groups and connective chain complexes of abelian groups.

Theorem (Dold–Puppe) 2.1. For A an abelian category there is an equivalence of categories N: A^Δ^op →← Ch•+(A) :Γ between
  - the category of simplicial objects in A;
  - the category of connective chain complexes in A;

Quillen equivalence of model categories

Both Ch•+(A) and A^Δop are categories with weak equivalences in an standard way:
  - the weak equivalences of simplicial abelian groups are the weak homotopy equivalences of the underlying Kan complexes, hence morphisms that induces isomorphisms on all simplicial homotopy group;
  - the weak equivalences of chain complexes are the quasi-isomorphisms: the morphisms that induces isomorphisms on all chain homology groups.

Proposition 2.6. These functors N and Γ both respect all weak equivalences with respect to the standard model structure on simplicial sets and on chain complexes in that they induce isomorphisms between simplicial homotopy groups and homology groups.

The structures of categories with weak equivalences have standard refinements to model category structures:
  - the projective model structure on chain complexes Ch• has as fibrations the chain maps that are surjections in each positive degree;
  - the model structure on simplicial abelian groups has as fibrations those whose underlying morphisms in sSet are fibrations (Kan fibrations) with respect to the standard model structure on simplicial sets.

Proposition 2.7. Both (N⊣Γ) as well as (Γ⊣N) are Quillen equivalences with respect to these model structures. The above Quillen equivalence is even a simplicial Quillen adjunction.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis
The homotopy hypothesis is the assertion that
    ∞-groupoids are equivalent to topological spaces (considered modulo weak homotopy equivalence)
or rather the stronger statement that
    n-groupoids are equivalent to homotopy n-types for all extended natural numbers n∈ℕ
and moreover
    this equivalence is induced by the fundamental ∞-groupoid construction.

* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kan+complex
The notion of a Kan complex is an abstraction of the combinatorial structure found in the singular simplicial complex of a topological space.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+Kan+complex
The notion of algebraic Kan complex is an algebraic definition of ∞-groupoids.

It builds on the classical geometric definition of ∞-groupoids in terms of Kan complexes. A Kan complex is like an algebraic ∞-groupoid in which we have forgotten what precisely the composition operation and what the inverses are, and only know that they do exist. This becomes an algebraic model for ∞-groupoids by adding the specific choices of composites back in.

The category AlgKan is the category of algebras over a monad
sSet→←AlgsSet.
This means that algebraic Kan complexes are formally an algebraic model for higher categories.

* Bar resolution

Simplicial sets from algebraic gadgets. Algebraic gadgets and adjoint functors. The unit and counit of an adjunction: the unit ‘includes the generators’, while the counit ‘evaluates formal expressions’. The canonical presentation of an algebraic gadget. Simplicial objects from adjunctions: the bar construction. 1-simplices as proofs.

- https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/05/on_the_bar_construction.html
  - the category Δ is the walking monoid
  - Δ^op is the “walking comonoid”. It’s nice to know by the way that Δ^op is equivalent to the category of finite intervals (i.e., finite totally ordered sets with a top and bottom, and maps which preserve the order and top and bottom)

With that, the bar construction is easy to construct. Let (M,m:M→M,u:1→M) be a monad on a category E. One has an adjunction
(F:E→E^M)⊣(U:E^M→E)
where E^M is the Eilenberg-Moore category of M-algebras. This in turn gives a comonad FU acting on M-algebras, that is to say, a comonoid in a monoidal category of endofunctors. Because Δ^op is the walking comonoid, there is a unique monoidal functor (the bar construction)
Bar_M:Δ^op→[E^M,E^M]
which sends the comonoid [1] in Δ^op to FU. Applying the functor which evaluates at an M-algebra X, one gets a simplicial M-algebra
B_M(X):Δ^op→E^M [... MMM X ≡> MMX => MX ->X]
and this is the bar construction applied to X.

What I want to talk about here is the conceptual sense in which the bar construction is a resolution of X, i.e., the acyclicity of the bar construction as a simplicial object. I also want to talk about the sense in which the bar construction on X is a universal M-free resolution of X.

The functor C^∞(−):SmoothMfd⟶Alg ℝ^op which sends a smooth manifold (finite dimensional, paracompact, second countable) to (the formal dual of) its ℝ-algebra of smooth functions is a full and faithful functor.
In other words, for two smooth manifolds X,Y there is a natural bijection between the smooth functions X→Y and the ℝ-algebra homomorphisms C^∞(X)←C^∞(Y).

Ad(P)→Trans(P)→codisc(M) (note all of these groupoids have object space M.)

There is another exact sequence of groupoids with object space M:
ΛPM→PM→codisc(M) where ΛPM is the inertia groupoid of PM - consists of only the loops.

Then what John talks about above is essentially a map from the second exact sequence to the first. The map ΛPM→Ad(P) materialises by universality of the kernel, and I’m talking about the strict kernel here. This last map looks like holonomy to me, and I wonder if given just ΛPM→Ad(P) we can find PM→Trans(P): reconstruct the connection form from its holonomy, but using just what we have here.
=> one can only reconstruct the connection up to gauge equivalence, but this I suppose is what one expects - uniqueness up to a unique 2-arrow.

- Yes! We have talked about this before: this is the “exponentiated Atiyah sequence” of a principal bundle. It is more familiar to many people in its differentiated version, where it becomes the ordinary Atiyah sequence of Lie algebroids over TM: 0→ad P→TP/G→TM→0.

Once I summarized some cool facts related to this in n-Transport and Higher Schreier Theory.

And I very much like your (David’s) observation that from a transport
tra:P_1 X→Trans(P)
we actually get a morphism of sequences of groupoids
Ω_1(X) → P_1(X)   → X×X 
↓ hol  ↓ tra      ↓ 
Ad P   → Trans(P) → X×X.
Here Ω_1(X) is the skeletal groupoid which is the loop group based at xx over each point x∈X.

- The situation is this
transport functor→{choose smooth local structure} descent data→{nice repackaging} anafunctor
Here “transport functor” is defined to be a functor which admits at least one smooth local trivialization.
And the cool thing is: one shows that if a functor admits any one smooth local trivialization at all, then this is unique up to isomorphism.
A smooth anafunctor is a neat way of repackaging an entire object of the descent category in terms of a single functor.
The anafunctor is the universal morphism by which the chosen local trivialization of the global transport functor factors through the universal one.

Connections and smooth anafunctors: review and prospectus. Connections on the trivial principal G-bundle over M are smooth functors hol:PM→G; gauge transformations are smooth natural transformations between these. Connections on a fixed principal G-bundle P→M are smooth functors hol:PM→Trans(P); gauge transformations are smooth natural transformations between these. Connections on an arbitrary, or variable principal G-bundle over MM are smooth anafunctors hol:PM→G; gauge transformations are smooth ananatural transformations between these. The definition of smooth anafunctor.

Parallel Transport and Functors
Urs Schreiber and Konrad Waldor
Parallel transport of a connection in a smooth fibre bundle yields a
functor from the path groupoid of the base manifold into a category that
describes the fibres of the bundle. We characterize functors obtained
like this by two notions we introduce: local trivializations and smooth
descent data. This provides a way to substitute categories of functors for
categories of smooth fibre bundles with connect ion. We indicate that this
concept can be generalized to connections in categorified bundles, and
how this generalization improves the understanding of higher dimensional
parallel transport.

The spaces (or generalized spaces, e.g., stacks) studied by algebraic geometers are invariably, and are usefully seen as, moduli spaces (or generalized moduli spaces) of models of some theory of some categorical doctrine.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/gauge+theory
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
- Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)-principal bundles with connection.
- Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.

Theorem 2.1. (Lawvere’s fixed-point theorem) In a cartesian closed category, if there is a point-surjective map ϕ:A→B, then every morphism f:B→B has a fixed point s:1→B (so that fs=s).

Proposition 2.4. (Cantor’s theorem in a topos) For any object X, there is an epimorphism f:X→Ω^X only if the topos is degenerate.

* Topos
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/realizability+topos
A realizability topos is a topos which embodies the realizability interpretation of intuitionistic number theory (due to Kleene) as part of its internal logic. Realizability toposes form an important class of elementary toposes that are not Grothendieck toposes, and don’t even have a geometric morphism to Set.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/effective+topos
The effective topos Eff is an example of an elementary topos with a natural numbers object which is not a Grothendieck topos (and doesn’t even have a geometric morphism to Set).
It is an environment for higher order recursion theory, where, in the internal logic, it is provable that every total function from natural numbers to natural numbers is recursive (furthermore, the functor Hom(1,−) from the effective topos into Set, the inverse image part of a geometric morphism Set→Eff preserves the natural numbers object, giving a suitable version of this result in the external logic as well).
It can be specified as the realizability topos for Kleene's first algebra.
