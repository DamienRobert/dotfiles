Eisenbud, exo 4.13:
===================
R semilocal, M,N de présentation finies.
Si M_P \iso N_P pour tout maximal P, alors M \iso N
(la difficulté est de construire l'application M \to N qui induit l'iso
localement en les P).

As rschwieb notes, commutative Artinian rings can always be factored
uniquely as a product of local Artinian rings, and the formation of this
factorization commutes with the passage to the maximal reduced quotient
(i.e. it is invariant under quotienting out by the nilradical).

Since a complete semilocal ring is (by definition) the projective limit of
A/InA, where I is the Jacoson radical and is the intersection of the
finitely many maximal ideals, applying the preceding paragraph to the
quotients A/InA (each of which is Artinian, and all of which has the same
maximal reduced quotient, namely A/IA), we obtain a factorization of A into
a product of finitely many complete local rings.

This result uses completeness in a crucial way (via passage to the Artinian
case). E.g. the localization of ℤ[i] at the prime ideal 5 of ℤ (i.e. invert
all elements coprime to 5) is semi-local (because there are two prime
ideals in ℤ[i] lying over the prime ideal 5 of ℤ), but is not a product of
local rings. (It is an integral domain, and so cannot be written as a
product in a non-trivial way.) Of course, if we 5-adically complete it,
then by the preceding discussion it will split as a product (of two copies
of ℤ5).
