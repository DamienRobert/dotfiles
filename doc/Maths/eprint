   Undecidability in number theory
        These lecture notes cover classical undecidability results in
        number theory, Hilbert's 10th problem and recent developments
        around it, also for rings other than the integers. It also contains
        a sketch of the authors result that the integers are universally
        definable in the rationals.

 An elementary approach to dessins d'enfants and the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group Pierre Guillot
     We give an account of the theory of dessins d'enfants which is both
     elementary and self-contained. We describe the equivalence of many
     categories (graphs embedded nicely on surfaces, finite sets with
     certain permutations, certain field extensions, and some classes of
     algebraic curves), some of which are naturally endowed with an action
     of the absolute Galois group of the rational field. We prove that the
     action is faithful. Eventually we prove that this absolute Galois
     group embeds into the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group $GT_0$
     introduced by Drinfel'd. There are explicit approximations of $GT_0$
     by finite groups, and we hope to encourage computations in this area.
     Our treatment includes a result which has not appeared in the
     literature yet: the Galois action on the subset of regular dessins
     - that is, those exhibiting maximal symmetry -- is also faithful.

   Basic Category Theory
     This short introduction to category theory is for readers with relatively little mathematical background. At its heart is the concept of a universal property, important throughout mathematics. After a chapter introducing the basic definitions, separate chapters present three ways of expressing universal properties: via adjoint functors, representable functors, and limits. A final chapter ties the three together.
    For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided, taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations.

 Book Review: 'A New Kind of Science'
Scott Aaronson
    This is a critical review of the book 'A New Kind of Science' by Stephen Wolfram. We do not attempt a chapter-by-chapter evaluation, but instead focus on two areas: computational complexity and fundamental physics. In complexity, we address some of the questions Wolfram raises using standard techniques in theoretical computer science. In physics, we examine Wolfram's proposal for a deterministic model underlying quantum mechanics, with 'long-range threads' to connect entangled particles. We show that this proposal cannot be made compatible with both special relativity and Bell inequality violation.

Computing supersingular isogenies on Kummer surfaces
Craig Costello

Abstract: We apply Scholten's construction to give explicit isogenies
between the Weil restriction of supersingular Montgomery curves with full
rational 2-torsion over GF(p2) and corresponding abelian surfaces over
GF(p). Subsequently, we show that isogeny-based public key cryptography can
exploit the fast Kummer surface arithmetic that arises from the theory of
theta functions. In particular, we show that chains of 2-isogenies between
elliptic curves can instead be computed as chains of Richelot
(2,2)-isogenies between Kummer surfaces. This gives rise to new
possibilities for efficient supersingular isogeny-based cryptography.

Genus Two Isogeny Cryptography
E.V. Flynn and Yan Bo Ti

Abstract: We study (ℓ,ℓ)-isogeny graphs of principally polarised supersingular abelian surfaces (PPSSAS). The (ℓ,ℓ)-isogeny graph has cycles of small length that can be used to break the collision resistance assumption of the genus two isogeny hash function suggested by Takashima. Algorithms for computing (2,2)-isogenies on the level of Jacobians and (3,3)-isogenies on the level of Kummers are used to develop a genus two version of the supersingular isogeny Diffie--Hellman protocol of Jao and de~Feo. The genus two isogeny Diffie--Hellman protocol achieves the same level of security as SIDH but uses a prime with a third of the bit length.

 An Isogeny-Based Password-Authenticated Key Establishment Protocol

Abstract: Password authenticated key establishment (PAKE) is a cryptographic primitive that allows two parties who share a low-entropy secret (a password) to securely establish cryptographic keys in the absence of public key infrastructure. We present the first quantum-resistant password-authenticated key exchange scheme based on supersingular elliptic curve isogenies. The scheme is built upon supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman, and uses the password to generate functions which obscure the auxiliary points used in the computation. We include a detailed security proof based on a number of reasonable computational problems on supersingular elliptic curves.

 New Hybrid Method for Isogeny-based Cryptosystems using Edwards Curves
 Suhri Kim and Kisoon Yoon and Jihoon Kwon and Young-Ho Park and Seokhie Hong

 Abstract: Along with the resistance against quantum computers,
 isogeny-based cryptography offers attractive cryptosystems due to small
 key sizes and compatibility with the current elliptic curve primitives.
 While the state-of-the-art implementation uses Montgomery curves which
 facilitates efficient elliptic curve arithmetic and isogeny computations,
 other forms of elliptic curves can be used to produce an efficient result.
 In this paper, we present the new hybrid method for isogeny-based
 cryptosystem using Edwards curves. Unlike the previous hybrid methods, we
 used Edwards curves for isogeny computations and Montgomery curves for
 other operations. We demonstrated that our hybrid method outperforms the
 previously proposed hybrid method, and is as fast as Montgomery-only
 implementation. We present the implementation results of Supersingular
 Isogeny Diffie--Hellman (SIDH) key exchange using the proposed hybrid
 method. Our results show that the use of Edwards curves for isogeny-based
 cryptosystem can be quite practical.

    Isogénies horizontales et classes d'isogénie de variétés abéliennes
    Nicolas Ratazzi (Submitted on 19 Nov 2012)
  The goal of this article is twofold. First we obtain a horizontal
  isogenies theorem (in the spirit of Frey-Jarden) for a certain (large)
  class of abelian varieties on a number field $K$. Secondly we apply this
  result in order to obtain a "radical caracterization", following
  Hall-Perucca, of the isogenies classes of abelian varieties in the
  preceeding class. Precisely we obtain a result for the abelian varieties
  faithfully of type GSp, a class containing the abelian varieties A/K of
  dimension 2 or odd and generic (such that the endomorphism ring is Z).

 Integral Tate modules and splitting of primes in torsion fields of elliptic curves
  Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $k$, and $\ell$ a
  prime number different from the characteristic of $k$. In this paper
  we consider the problem of finding the structure of the Tate module
  $T_\ell(E)$ as an {\it integral} Galois representations of $k$. We
  show that the characteristic polynomial of the arithmetic Frobenius
  and the $j$-invariant of $E$ suffice to this purpose in almost all
  cases. Hilbert Class Polynomials of imaginary quadratic orders play
  an important role. We give an application to the splitting of primes
  in torsion fields arising from elliptic curves over number fields.

 Frobenius lifts and point counting for smooth curves
 Amnon Besser, François-Renaud Escriva, Rob de Jeu
     We describe an algorithm to compute the zeta-function of a proper,
     smooth curve over a finite field, when the curve is given together
     with some auxiliary data. Our method is based on computing the matrix
     of the action of a semi-linear Frobenius on the first cohomology group
     of the curve by means of Serre duality. The cup product involved can
     be computed locally, after first computing local expansions of a
     globally defined lift of Frobenius. The resulting algorithm's
     complexity is softly cubic in the field degree, which is also the case
     with Kedlaya's algorithm in the hyperelliptic case.

 On the number of elliptic curves with prescribed isogeny or torsion group over number fields of prime degree
 Filip Najman
   Let $p$ be a prime and $K$ a number field of degree $p$. We count the
   number of elliptic curves, up to $\bar{K}$-isomorphism, having a
   prescribed property, where this property is either that the curve
   contains a fixed torsion group as a subgroup, or that it has an isogeny
   of prescribed degree. We also study the following question: for a given
   $n$ such that $|Y_0(n)(\Q)|>0$, does every elliptic curve over $K$ with
   an $n$-isogeny have a quadratic twist with torsion $\Z/n\Z$ as a
   subgroup? We prove that this is true only for the cases $n=2,3,4,6$ and
   for the pairs $(n,K)=(11, \Q(\zeta_{11})^+)$ and $(n,K)=(14,
   \Q(\zeta_{7})^+)$.

  Exploiting Collisions in Addition Chain-based Exponentiation Algorithms
  Neil Hanley and HeeSeok Kim and Michael Tunstall
    Abstract: Public key cryptographic algorithms are typically based on group
    exponentiation algorithms, and many algorithms have been proposed in the
    literature based on addition chains. We describe attacks based on
    collisions of variables manipulated in group operations extending attacks
    described in the literature. These collisions are visible where one is able
    to acquire information through some suitable side channel that provides a
    trace during the computation of a group exponentiation algorithm. For
    example, through measuring the instantaneous power consumption or the
    electromagnetic emanations of a microprocessor. The advantage of our
    attacks over previous work is that the attacks can be applied to a single
    trace and do not require any knowledge of the input to the exponentiation
    algorithm. Moreover, we prove that our attacks are applicable to all
    addition chain-based exponentiation algorithms. This means that a side
    channel resistant implementation of a group exponentiation will require
    countermeasures that introduce enough noise that an attack is not
    practical.

 Index conditions and cup-product maps on abelian varieties
    We study questions surrounding cup-product maps which arise from
    pairs of non-degenerate line bundles on an abelian variety. Important
    to our work is Mumford's index theorem which we use to prove that
    non-degenerate line bundles exhibit positivity analogous to that of
    ample line bundles. As an application we determine the asymptotic
    behaviour of families of cup-product maps and prove that vector
    bundles associated to these families are asymptotically globally
    generated. To illustrate our results we provide several examples. For
    instance, we construct families of cup-product problems which result
    in a zero map on a one dimensional locus. We also prove that the
    hypothesis of our results can be satisfied, in all possible
    instances, by a particular class of simple abelian varieties.
    Finally, we discuss the extent to which Mumford's theta groups are
    applicable in our more general setting.

 Integral Models of $X_0(N)$ and Their Degrees
 Goran Mui\' c
     In this paper we compute the degree of a curve which is the image of a
     mapping $z\longmapsto (f(z): g(z): h(z))$ constructed out of three
     linearly independent modular forms of the same even weight $\ge 4$
     into $\mathbb P^2$. We prove that in most cases this map is a
     birational equivalence and defined over $\mathbb Z$. We use this to
     construct models of $X_0(N)$, $N\ge 2$, using modular forms in
     $M_{12}(\Gamma_0(N))$ with integral $q$--expansion. The models have
     degree equal to $\psi(N)$ (a classical Dedekind psi function). When
     genus is at least one, we show the existence of models constructed
     using cuspidal forms in $S_4(\Gamma_0(N))$ of degree $\le \psi(N)/3$
     and in $S_6(\Gamma_0(11))$ of degree 4. As an example of a different
     kind, we compute the formula for the total degree i.e., the degree
     considered as a polynomial of two (independent) variables of the
     classical modular polynomial (or the degree of the canonical model of
     $X_0(N)$).

 On a Relation between the Ate Pairing and the Weil Pairing for Supersingular Elliptic Curves
 Takakazu Satoh
 Abstract: The hyperelliptic curve Ate pairing provides an efficient way to
 compute a bilinear pairing on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic
 curve. We prove that, for supersingular elliptic curves with embedding
 degree two, square of the Ate pairing is nothing but the Weil pairing.
 Using the formula, we develop an X-coordinate only pairing inversion
 method. However, the algorithm is still infeasible for cryptographic size
 problems.

 Improved Security for a Ring-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme
 Joppe W. Bos and Kristin Lauter and Jake Loftus and Michael Naehrig
 Abstract: In 1996, Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman introduced an efficient lattice based encryption scheme dubbed NTRUEnc. Unfortunately, this scheme lacks a proof of security. However, in 2011, Stehle and Steinfeld showed how to modify NTRUEnc to reduce security to standard problems in ideal lattices. In 2012, Lopez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehle and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.

 Faster Bootstrapping with Polynomial Error
Jacob Alperin-Sheriff and Chris Peikert
Abstract: \emph{Bootstrapping} is a technique, originally due to Gentry (STOC 2009), for ``refreshing'' ciphertexts of a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme so that they can support further homomorphic operations. To date, bootstrapping remains the only known way of obtaining fully homomorphic encryption for arbitrary unbounded computations.
Over the past few years, several works have dramatically improved the efficiency of bootstrapping and the hardness assumptions needed to implement it. Recently, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan~(ITCS~2014) reached the major milestone of a bootstrapping algorithm based on Learning With Errors for \emph{polynomial} approximation factors. Their method uses the Gentry-Sahai-Waters~(GSW) cryptosystem~(CRYPTO~2013) in conjunction with Barrington's ``circuit sequentialization'' theorem~(STOC~1986). This approach, however, results in \emph{very large} polynomial runtimes and approximation factors. (The approximation factors can be improved, but at even greater costs in runtime and space.)
In this work we give a new bootstrapping algorithm whose runtime and associated approximation factor are both \emph{small} polynomials. Unlike most previous methods, ours implements an elementary and efficient \emph{arithmetic} procedure, thereby avoiding the inefficiencies inherent to the use of boolean circuits and Barrington's Theorem. For $2^{\lambda}$ security under conventional lattice assumptions, our method requires only a \emph{quasi-linear} $\Otil(\lambda)$ number of homomorphic operations on GSW ciphertexts, which is optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) for schemes that encrypt just one bit per ciphertext. As a contribution of independent interest, we also give a technically simpler variant of the GSW system and a tighter error analysis for its homomorphic operations.

  Kummer strikes back: new DH speed records
  Daniel J. Bernstein and Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup and Tanja Lange and Peter Schwabe
  Abstract: This paper introduces high-security constant-time variable-base-point Diffie--Hellman software using just 274593 Cortex-A8 cycles, 91460 Sandy Bridge cycles, 90896 Ivy Bridge cycles, or 72220 Haswell cycles. The only higher speed appearing in the literature for any of these platforms is a claim of 60000 Haswell cycles for unpublished software performing arithmetic on a binary elliptic curve.
  The new speeds rely on a synergy between (1) state-of-the-art formulas for genus-2 hyperelliptic curves and (2) a modern trend towards vectorization in CPUs. The paper introduces several new techniques for efficient vectorization of Kummer-surface computations.

  The Multiple Number Field Sieve for Medium and High Characteristic Finite Fields
  Razvan Barbulescu and Cécile Pierrot
  Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete logarithm problem in medium and high characteristic finite fields. We propose a variant of the Number Field Sieve (NFS) based on numerous number fields. Our improved algorithm computes discrete logarithms in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for the whole range of applicability of NFS and lowers the asymptotic complexity from $L_{p^n}(1/3, (128/9)^{1/3})$ to $L_{p^n}(1/3, (2^{13} /3^6)^{1/3})$ in the medium characteristic case, and from $L_{p^n} (1/3, (64/9)^{1/3})$ to $L_{p^n}(1/3,((92 + 26\sqrt{13})/27))^{1/3})$ in the high characteristic case.

We start with a precise analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms for computing discrete logarithms that are suitable for finite fields related to pairing-friendly constructions. To improve upon these algorithms, we extend the Special Number Field Sieve to compute discrete logarithms in $\F_{p^{n}}$, where $p$ has an adequate sparse representation. Our improved algorithm works for the whole range of applicability of the Number Field Sieve.

   Point compression for the trace zero subgroup over a small degree extension field
  Elisa Gorla and Maike Massierer
  Abstract: Using Semaev's summation polynomials, we derive a new equation for the $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the trace zero variety of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Using this equation, we produce an optimal-size representation for such points. Our representation is compatible with scalar multiplication. We give a point compression algorithm to compute the representation and a decompression algorithm to recover the original point (up to some small ambiguity). The algorithms are efficient for trace zero varieties coming from small degree extension fields. We give explicit equations and discuss in detail the practically relevant cases of cubic and quintic field extensions.

Sparse Gröbner Bases: the Unmixed Case
Jean-Charles Faugere 1, Pierre-Jean Spaenlehauer 2, Jules Svartz 1
(18/01/2014)
Toric (or sparse) elimination theory is a framework developped during the last decades to exploit monomial structures in systems of Laurent polynomials. Roughly speaking, this amounts to computing in a \emph{semigroup algebra}, \emph{i.e.} an algebra generated by a subset of Laurent monomials. In order to solve symbolically sparse systems, we introduce \emph{sparse Gröbner bases}, an analog of classical Gröbner bases for semigroup algebras, and we propose sparse variants of the $F_5$ and FGLM algorithms to compute them. Our prototype ''proof-of-concept'' implementation shows large speed-ups (more than 100 for some examples) compared to optimized (classical) Gröbner bases software. Moreover, in the case where the generating subset of monomials corresponds to the points with integer coordinates in a normal lattice polytope $\polytope\subset\R^n$ and under regularity assumptions, we prove complexity bounds which depend on the combinatorial properties of $\polytope$. These bounds yield new estimates on the complexity of solving $0$-dimensional systems via Gröbner bases when all polynomials share the same Newton polytope (\emph{unmixed case}). For instance, we generalize the bound $\min(n_1,n_2)+1$ on the maximal degree in a Gröbner basis of a $0$-dimensional bilinear system with blocks of variables of sizes $(n_1,n_2)$ to the multilinear case: $\sum n_i - \max(n_i)+1$. We also propose a variant of Fröberg's conjecture which allows us to estimate the complexity of solving overdetermined sparse systems. Finally, our complexity results apply in the dense (usual) case and, as a surprising by-product, we prove that restrictive assumptions in usual complexity estimates of classical inhomogeneous Gröbner bases algorithms can be removed.

 Very strong approximation for certain algebraic varieties
Qing Liu, Fei Xu
    Let F be a global field. In this work, we show that the Brauer-Manin condition on adelic points for subvarieties of a torus T over F cuts out exactly the rational points, if either F is a function field or, if F is the field of rational numbers and T is split. As an application, we prove a conjecture of Harari-Voloch over global function fields which states, roughly speaking, that on any rational hyperbolic curve, the local integral points with the Brauer-Manin condition are the global integral points. Finally we prove for tori over number fields a theorem of Stoll on adelic points of zero-dimensional subvarieties in abelian varieties.

Time-Memory Trade-offs for Index Calculus in Genus 3
Kim Laine and Kristin Lauter
Abstract: In this paper, we present a variant of Diem's $\widetilde{O}(q)$ index calculus algorithm to attack the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in Jacobians of genus 3 non-hyperelliptic curves over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We implement this new variant in C++ and study the complexity in both theory and practice, making the logarithmic factors and constants hidden in the $\widetilde{O}$-notation precise. Our variant improves the computational complexity at the cost of a moderate increase in memory consumption, but we also improve the computational complexity even when we limit the memory usage to that of Diem's original algorithm. Finally, we examine how parallelization can help to reduce both the memory cost per computer and the running time for our algorithms.

Hyper-and-elliptic-curve cryptography
Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange
Abstract: This paper introduces "hyper-and-elliptic-curve cryptography", in which a single high-security group supports fast genus-2-hyperelliptic-curve formulas for variable-base-point single-scalar multiplication (e.g., Diffie--Hellman shared-secret computation) and at the same time supports fast elliptic-curve formulas for fixed-base-point scalar multiplication (e.g., key generation) and multi-scalar multiplication (e.g., signature verification).

Jacobian Coordinates on Genus 2 Curves
Huseyin Hisil and Craig Costello
Abstract: This paper presents a new projective coordinate system and new explicit algorithms which together boost the speed of arithmetic in the divisor class group of genus 2 curves. The proposed formulas generalise the use of Jacobian coordinates on elliptic curves, and their application improves the speed of performing cryptographic scalar multiplications in Jacobians of genus 2 curves over prime fields by an approximate factor of 1.25x. For example, on a single core of an Intel Core i7-3770M (Ivy Bridge), we show that replacing the previous best formulas with our new set improves the cost of generic scalar multiplications from 243,000 to 195,000 cycles, and drops the cost of specialised GLV-style scalar multiplications from 166,000 to 129,000 cycles.

Constructing Abelian Surfaces for Cryptography via Rosenhain Invariants
Craig Costello and Alyson Deines-Schartz and Kristin Lauter and Tonghai Yang
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm to construct cryptographically strong genus 2 curves and their Kummer surfaces via Rosenhain invariants and related Kummer parameters. The most common version of the complex multiplication (CM) algorithm for constructing cryptographic curves in genus 2 relies on the well-studied Igusa invariants and Mestre's algorithm for reconstructing the curve. On the other hand, the Rosenhain invariants typically have much smaller height, so computing them requires less precision, and in addition, the Rosenhain model for the curve can be written down directly given the Rosenhain invariants. Similarly, the parameters for a Kummer surface can be expressed directly in terms of rational functions of theta constants. CM-values of these functions are algebraic numbers, and when computed to high enough precision, LLL can recognize their minimal polynomials. Motivated by fast cryptography on Kummer surfaces, we investigate a variant of the CM method for computing cryptographically strong Rosenhain models of curves (as well as their associated Kummer surfaces) and use it to generate several example curves at different security levels that are suitable for use in cryptography.

Revisiting the Gentry-Szydlo Algorithm
H. W. Lenstra and A. Silverberg
Abstract: We put the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm into a mathematical framework, and show that it is part of a general theory of ``lattices with symmetry''. For large ranks, there is no good algorithm that decides whether a given lattice has an orthonormal basis. But when the lattice is given with enough symmetry, we can construct a provably deterministic polynomial time algorithm to accomplish this, based on the work of Gentry and Szydlo. The techniques involve algorithmic algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, commutative algebra, and lattice basis reduction. This sheds new light on the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm, and the ideas should be applicable to a range of questions in cryptography.

How to manipulate curve standards: a white paper for the black hat
Daniel J. Bernstein and Tung Chou and Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup and Andreas H\"ulsing and Tanja Lange and Ruben Niederhagen and Christine van Vredendaal
Abstract: This paper analyzes the cost of breaking ECC under the following assumptions: (1) ECC is using a standardized elliptic curve that was actually chosen by an attacker; (2) the attacker is aware of a vulnerability in some curves that are not publicly known to be vulnerable.
This cost includes the cost of exploiting the vulnerability, but also the initial cost of computing a curve suitable for sabotaging the standard. This initial cost depends upon the acceptability criteria used by the public to decide whether to allow a curve as a standard, and (in most cases) also upon the chance of a curve being vulnerable.
This paper shows the importance of accurately modeling the actual acceptability criteria: i.e., figuring out what the public can be fooled into accepting. For example, this paper shows that plausible models of the “Brainpool acceptability criteria” allow the attacker to target a one-in-a-million vulnerability.

 Computing on the Edge of Chaos: Structure and Randomness in Encrypted Computation

http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/610
Craig Gentry
This survey, aimed mainly at mathematicians rather than practitioners, covers recent developments in homomorphic encryption (computing on encrypted data) and program obfuscation (generating encrypted but functional programs). Current schemes for encrypted computation all use essentially the same "noisy" approach: they encrypt via a noisy encoding of the message, they decrypt using an "approximate" ring homomorphism, and in between they employ techniques to carefully control the noise as computations are performed. This noisy approach uses a delicate balance between structure and randomness: structure that allows correct computation despite the randomness of the encryption, and randomness that maintains privacy against the adversary despite the structure. While the noisy approach "works", we need new techniques and insights, both to improve efficiency and to better understand encrypted computation conceptually.

 On the complexity of integer matrix multiplication
David Harvey, Joris Van Der Hoeven
Abstract : Let M(n) denote the bit complexity of multiplying n-bit integers, let ω ∈ (2, 3] be an exponent for matrix multiplication, and let lg* n be the iterated logarithm. Assuming that log d = O(n) and that M(n) / (n log n) is increasing, we prove that d × d matrices with n-bit integer entries may be multiplied in O(d^2 M(n) + d^ω n 2^O(lg* n − lg* d) M(lg d) / lg d) bit operations. In particular, if n is large compared to d, say d = O(log n), then the complexity is only O(d^2 M(n)).

A New Proof of an Arithmetic Riemann-Roch Theorem
Sam Mundy
    In this paper, we give a new proof of an arithmetic analogue of the Riemann-Roch Theorem, due originally to Serge Lang. Lang's result was first proved using the lattice point geometry of Minkowski. By contrast, our proof is completely adelic. It has the conceptual advantage that it uses a different analogue of the Riemann-Roch theorem proved by Tate in his thesis, in a manner similar to the proof of the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves over finite fields which uses Tate's theorem. Thus our proof provides a bridge between a lot of the Riemann-Roch theory that exists in arithmetic.

Cryptanalysis of the Multilinear Map over the Integers
Jung Hee Cheon and Kyoohyung Han and Changmin Lee and Hansol Ryu and Damien Stehl\'e
Abstract: We describe a polynomial-time cryptanalysis of the (approximate) multilinear map of Coron, Lepoint and Tibouchi (CLT). The attack relies on an adaptation of the so-called zeroizing attack against the Garg, Gentry and Halevi (GGH) candidate multilinear map. Zeroizing is much more devastating for CLT than for GGH. In the case of GGH, it allows to break generalizations of the Decision Linear and Subgroup Membership problems from pairing-based cryptography. For CLT, this leads to a total break: all quantities meant to be kept secret can be efficiently and publicly recovered.

Faster polynomial multiplication over finite fields 
 Let p be a prime, and let M_p(n) denote the bit complexity of multiplying two polynomials in F_p[X] of degree less than n. For n large compared to p, we establish the bound M_p(n)=O(n log n 8^(log^∗ n) log p), where log^∗ is the iterated logarithm. This is the first known Fürer-type complexity bound for F_p[X], and improves on the previously best known bound M_p(n)=O(n log n log log n log p).

 Even faster integer multiplication 
 We give a new proof of Fürer's bound for the cost of multiplying n-bit integers in the bit complexity model. Unlike Fürer, our method does not require constructing special coefficient rings with ''fast'' roots of unity. Moreover, we establish the improved bound O(n log n K^(log^∗ n)) with K=8. We show that an optimised variant of Fürer's algorithm achieves only K=16, suggesting that the new algorithm is faster than Fürer's by a factor of 2^(log^∗ n). Assuming standard conjectures about the distribution of Mersenne primes, we give yet another algorithm that achieves K=4.

 Some New Results on Binary Polynomial Multiplication
 Murat Cenk and M. Anwar Hasan
 Abstract: This paper presents several methods for reducing the number of bit operations for multiplication of polynomials over the binary field. First, a modified Bernstein’s 3-way algorithm is introduced, followed by a new 5-way algorithm. Next, a new 3-way algorithm that improves asymptotic arithmetic complexity compared to Bernstein’s 3-way algorithm is introduced. This new algorithm uses three multiplications of one-third size polynomials over the binary field and one multiplication of one-third size polynomials over the finite field with four elements. Unlike Bernstein’s algorithm, which has a linear delay complexity with respect to input size, the delay complexity of the new algorithm is logarithmic. The number of bit operations for the multiplication of polynomials over the finite field with four elements is also computed. Finally, all these new results are combined to obtain improved complexities.

  Provably weak instances of Ring-LWE
  Yara Elias and Kristin E. Lauter and Ekin Ozman and Katherine E. Stange
  Abstract: The ring and polynomial learning with errors problems (Ring-LWE and Poly-LWE) have been proposed as hard problems to form the basis for cryptosystems, and various security reductions to hard lattice problems have been presented. So far these problems have been stated for general (number) rings but have only been closely examined for cyclotomic number rings. In this paper, we state and examine the Ring-LWE problem for general number rings and demonstrate provably weak instances of Ring-LWE. We construct an explicit family of number fields for which we have an efficient attack. We demonstrate the attack in both theory and practice, providing code and running times for the attack. The attack runs in time linear in q, where q is the modulus.
  Our attack is based on the attack on Poly-LWE which was presented in [EHL]. We extend the EHL-attack to apply to a larger class of number fields, and show how it applies to attack Ring-LWE for a heuristically large class of fields. Certain Ring-LWE instances can be transformed into Poly-LWE instances without distorting the error too much, and thus provide the first weak instances of the Ring-LWE problem. We also provide additional examples of fields which are vulnerable to our attacks on Poly-LWE, including power-of-2 cyclotomic fields, presented using the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_{2^n} \pm 1$.

 New algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves
Igor Semaev
A new algorithms for computing discrete logarithms on elliptic curves defined over finite fields is suggested. It is based on a new method to find zeroes of summation polynomials. In binary elliptic curves one is to solve a cubic system of Boolean equations. Under a first fall degree assumption the regularity degree of the system is at most $4$. Extensive experimental data which supports the assumption is provided. An heuristic analysis suggests a new asymptotical complexity bound $2^{c\sqrt{n\ln n}}, c\approx 1.69$ for computing discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve over a field of size $2^n$. For several binary elliptic curves recommended by FIPS the new method performs better than Pollard's.

 Matrix Computational Assumptions in Multilinear Groups
Paz Morillo and Carla Ràfols and Jorge L. Villar
Abstract: We put forward a new family of computational assumptions, the Kernel Matrix Diffie-Hellman Assumption. This family abstracts and includes as a special case several assumptions used in the literature under different names. Given some matrix $\matrA$ sampled from some distribution $\mathcal{D}_{\ell,k}$, the kernel assumption says that it is hard to find ``in the exponent'' a nonzero vector in the kernel of $\mathbf{A}^\top$. Our assumption is the natural computational analogue of the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption (MDDH), proposed by Escala \textit{et al}.

 On Generalized First Fall Degree Assumptions
Yun-Ju Huang and Christophe Petit and Naoyuki Shinohara and Tsuyoshi Takagi
Abstract: The first fall degree assumption provides a complexity approximation of Gr\"obner basis algorithms when the degree of regularity of a polynomial system cannot be precisely evaluated. Most importantly, this assumption was recently used by Petit and Quisquater's to conjecture that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem can be solved in subexponential time for binary fields (binary ECDLP). The validity of the assumption may however depend on the systems in play.

 The Tower Number Field Sieve
Razvan Barbulescu 1 Pierrick Gaudry 2 Thorsten Kleinjung 3
Abstract : The security of pairing-based crypto-systems relies on the difficulty to compute discrete logarithms in finite fields Fpn where n is a small integer larger than 1. The state-of-art algorithm is the number field sieve (NFS) together with its many variants. When p has a special form (SNFS), as in many pairings constructions, NFS has a faster variant due to Joux and Pierrot. We present a new NFS variant for SNFS computations, which is better for some cryptographically relevant cases, according to a precise comparison of norm sizes. The new algorithm is an adaptation of Schirokauer's variant of NFS based on tower extensions, for which we give a middlebrow presentation.

Computing Individual Discrete Logarithms Faster in GF(p^n)
Aurore Guillevic 1, 2, *
Abstract : The Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithm is the best known method to compute discrete logarithms (DL) in large characteristic finite fields Fp^n , with p large and n ≥ 1 small. This algorithm comprises four steps: polynomial selection, relation collection, linear algebra and finally, individual logarithm computation. The first step outputs two numbers fields equipped with a map to Fp^n. After the relation collection and linear algebra phases, the (virtual) logarithm of a subset of elements in each number field is known. The fourth step computes a preimage in one number field of the target element in Fp^n. If one can write the target preimage as a product of elements of known (virtual) logarithm, then one can deduce the discrete logarithm of the target. The traditional approach for the individual logarithm step can be extremely slow, and it is too slow especially for n greater than 3. Its asymptotic complexity is L_Q [1/3, c] with c ≥ 1.44. We present a new preimage computation that provides a dramatic improvement for individual logarithm computations for small n, both in practice and in asymptotic running-time: we have L_Q [1/3, c] with c = 1.14 for n = 2, 4, c = 1.26 for n = 3, 6 and c = 1.34 for n = 5. Our method generalizes to any n; in particular c < 1.44 for the two state-of-the-art variants of NFS for extension fields.

    We construct certain isogeny graphs of principally polarized ordinary abelian surfaces over finite fields and prove (under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) rapid mixing properties for these graphs. We use these graphs, together with a recent algorithm of Dudeanu, Jetchev and Robert for computing explicit isogenies in genus 2, to prove ran- dom self-reducibility of the discrete logarithm problem within the subclass of principally polarizable ordinary abelian surfaces with maximal endomorphism ring. In addition, we remove the heuristics in the complexity analysis of an algorithm of Galbraith for explicitly computing isogenies between two elliptic curves in the same isogeny class and generalize it in genus 2.

 Type 2 Structure-Preserving Signature Schemes Revisited
Sanjit Chatterjee and Alfred Menezes
Abstract: At CRYPTO 2014, Abe et al. presented generic-signer structure-preserving signature schemes using Type 2 pairings. According to the authors, the proposed constructions are optimal with only two group elements in each signature and just one verification equation. The schemes beat the known lower bounds in the Type 3 setting and thereby establish that the Type 2 setting permits construction of cryptographic schemes with unique properties not achievable in Type 3.
In this paper we undertake a concrete analysis of the Abe et al. claims. By properly accounting for the actual structure of the underlying groups and subgroup membership testing of group elements in signatures, we show that the schemes are not as efficient as claimed. We present natural Type 3 analogues of the Type 2 schemes, and show that the Type 3 schemes are superior to their Type 2 counterparts in every aspect. We also formally establish that in the concrete mathematical structure of asymmetric pairing, all Type 2 structure-preserving signature schemes can be converted to the Type 3 setting without any penalty in security or efficiency, and show that the converse is false. Furthermore, we prove that the Type 2 setting does not allow one to circumvent the known lower bound result for the Type 3 setting. Our analysis puts the optimality claims for Type 2 structure-preserving signature in a concrete perspective and indicates an incompleteness in the definition of a generic bilinear group in the Type 2 setting.

The security of the new algorithms is an important issue for the use of practical cryptography. Side channel attacks are powerful attacks, using the leakage of information to reveal sensitive data. The pairings over elliptic curves were sensitive to side channel attacks. In this article, we study the weaknesses of the Tate pairing over Theta functions when submitted to side channel attacks.

 Which Ring Based Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption Scheme is Best?
Anamaria Costache and Nigel P. Smart
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to compare side-by-side the NTRU and BGV schemes in their non-scale invariant (messages in the lower bits), and their scale invariant (message in the upper bits) forms. The scale invariant versions are often called the FV and YASHE schemes. As an additional optimization, we also investigate the affect of modulus reduction on the scale-invariant schemes. We compare the schemes using the ``average case'' noise analysis presented by Gentry et al. In addition we unify notation and techniques so as to show commonalities between the schemes. We find that the BGV scheme appears to be more efficient for large plaintext moduli, whilst YASHE seems more efficient for small plaintext moduli (although the benefit is not as great as one would have expected).

Our purpose is to attempt to evaluate some of the theories that have been proposed.

 Extended Tower Number Field Sieve: A New Complexity for Medium Prime Case
 Taechan Kim
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the tower number field sieve~(TNFS) proposed by Barbulescu, Gaudry, and Kleinjung in Asaicrypt 2015. Our generalization based on the JLSV algorithm (by Joux, Lercier, Smart, and Vercautern, Crypto 2006) shows that one can solve the discrete logarithm over the field $\F_Q := \F_{p^n}$ in time complexity, L_Q( 1/3, (64/9)^{1/3} ), for p = L_Q( \ell_p) with some \ell_p > 1/3.
This should be compared that the previous NFS algorithms only assures this bound either when $\ell_p > 2/3$ (the JLSV algorithm) or when $p$ is of special form when $1/3 < \ell_p < 2/3$ (by Joux and Pierrot, Pairing 2013).
Even more, when we apply some variants (such as the multiple number field sieve or the special number field sieve) to our algorithm, then we show that the above complexity is further improved.

Abstract: This note can be seen as an appendix of a recent paper of Kim [Kim15]. We show that the discrete logarithm problem in fields GF(Q) where Q = p n wit^ p of medium size and n having a factor of the good size (specified in the article) has a complexity of L_Q(1/3, (48/9)^(1/3)).

 Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves
Joost Renes and Craig Costello and Lejla Batina
Abstract: An elliptic curve addition law is said to be complete if it correctly computes the sum of any two points in the elliptic curve group. One of the main reasons for the increased popularity of Edwards curves in the ECC community is that they can allow a complete group law that is also relatively efficient (e.g., when compared to all known addition laws on Edwards curves). Such complete addition formulas can simplify the task of an ECC implementer and, at the same time, can greatly reduce the potential vulnerabilities of a cryptosystem. Unfortunately, until now, complete addition laws that are relatively efficient have only been proposed on curves of composite order and have thus been incompatible with all of the currently standardized prime order curves.
In this paper we present optimized addition formulas that are complete on every prime order short Weierstrass curve defined over a field k with char(k) not 2 or 3. Compared to their incomplete counterparts, these formulas require a larger number of field additions, but interestingly require fewer field multiplications. We discuss how these formulas can be used to achieve secure, exception-free implementations on all of the prime order curves in the NIST (and many other) standards.

 The CM class number one problem for curves of genus 2
Pınar Kılıçer 1, 2, 3 Marco Streng 3
Abstract : The CM class number one problem for elliptic curves asked to find all elliptic curves defined over the rationals with non-trivial endomorphism ring. For genus-2 curves it is the problem of determining all CM curves of genus 2 defined over the reflex field. We solve the problem by showing that the list given in Bouyer–Streng [3, Tables 1a, 1b, 2b, and 2c] is complete.

Degenerate Curve Attacks
Samuel Neves and Mehdi Tibouchi
Abstract: Invalid curve attacks are a well-known class of attacks against implementations of elliptic curve cryptosystems, in which an adversary tricks the cryptographic device into carrying out scalar multiplication not on the expected secure curve, but on some other, weaker elliptic curve of his choosing. In their original form, however, these attacks only affect elliptic curve implementations using addition and doubling formulas that are independent of at least one of the curve parameters. This property is typically satisfied for elliptic curves in Weierstrass form but not for newer models that have gained increasing popularity in recent years, like Edwards and twisted Edwards curves. It has therefore been suggested (e.g. in the original paper on invalid curve attacks) that such alternate models could protect against those attacks.
In this paper, we dispel that belief and present the first attack of this nature against (twisted) Edwards curves, Jacobi quartics, Jacobi intersections and more. Our attack differs from invalid curve attacks proper in that the cryptographic device is tricked into carrying out a computation not on another elliptic curve, but on a group isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the underlying base field. This often makes it easy to recover the secret scalar with a single invalid computation.
We also show how our result can be used constructively, especially on curves over random base fields, as a fault attack countermeasure similar to Shamir's trick.

 Missing a trick: Karatsuba revisited
Mike Scott
Abstract: There are a variety of ways of applying the Karatsuba idea to multi-digit multiplication. These apply particularly well in the context where digits do not use the full word-length of the computer, so that partial products can be safely accumulated without fear of overflow. Here we re-visit the ``arbitrary degree'' version of Karatsuba and show that the cost of this little-known variant has been over-estimated in the past. We also attempt to definitively answer the question as to the cross-over point where Karatsuba performs better than the classic method.

2 University of New South Wales [Sydney]
Abstract : Modern cryptographic constructions are based on constructions from number theory, but many of the links go deeper than typically realized. The development of modern cryptography runs in parallel to developments and central questions in number theory. After recalling some of the constructions used in modern public key cryptography, based on modular arithmetic, finite fields, lattices and elliptic curves, we describe some of their number theoretic origins. The first concerns the Riemann hypothesis and associated questions of distributions of prime numbers and smooth numbers, and of distributions of divisors of integers. Next we consider the origins of elliptic curve cryptography, beginning from Hasse's theorem, the conjectures of Weil, and Schoof's algorithm. Finally we mention the context of Mordell's theorem and the conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. In conclusion we consider the future prospects of these cryptosystems.

 Efficient arithmetic on elliptic curves in characteristic 2
David Kohel 1
Abstract : We present normal forms for elliptic curves over a field of characteristic 2 analogous to Edwards normal form, and determine bases of addition laws, which provide strikingly simple expressions for the group law. We deduce efficient algorithms for point addition and scalar multiplication on these forms. The resulting algorithms apply to any elliptic curve over a field of characteristic 2 with a 4-torsion point, via an isomorphism with one of the normal forms. We deduce algorithms for duplication in time 2M+5S+2mc2M+5S+2mc and for addition of points in time 7M+2S7M+2S, where MM is the cost of multiplication, SS the cost of squaring , and mcmc the cost of multiplication by a constant. By a study of the Kummer curves =E/{±1]}K=E/{±1]}, we develop an algorithm for scalar multiplication with point recovery which computes the multiple of a point P with 4M+4S+2mc+mt4M+4S+2mc+mt per bit where mtmt is multiplication by a constant that depends on PP.

 The geometry of efficient arithmetic on elliptic curves
David Kohel 1
Abstract : The arithmetic of elliptic curves, namely polynomial addition and scalar multiplication, can be described in terms of global sections of line bundles on $E\times E$ and $E$, respectively, with respect to a given projective embedding of $E$ in $\mathbb{P}^r$. By means of a study of the finite dimensional vector spaces of global sections, we reduce the problem of constructing and finding efficiently computable polynomial maps defining the addition morphism or isogenies to linear algebra. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by improving the best known complexity for doubling and tripling, by considering families of elliptic curves admiting a $2$-torsion or $3$-torsion point.

 Arithmetic of split Kummer surfaces: Montgomery endomorphism of Edwards products
David Kohel 1
Abstract : Let $E$ be an elliptic curve, $\mathcal{K}_1$ its Kummer curve $E/\{\pm1\}$, $E^2$ its square product, and $\mathcal{K}_2$ the split Kummer surface $E^2/\{\pm1\}$. The addition law on $E^2$ gives a large endomorphism ring, which induce endomorphisms of $\mathcal{K}_2$. With a view to the practical applications to scalar multiplication on $\mathcal{K}_1$, we study the explicit arithmetic of $\mathcal{K}_2$.

 Addition law structure of elliptic curves
David Kohel 1
Abstract : The study of alternative models for elliptic curves has found recent interest from cryptographic applications, once it was recognized that such models provide more efficiently computable algorithms for the group law than the standard Weierstrass model. Examples of such models arise via symmetries induced by a rational torsion structure. We analyze the module structure of the space of sections of the addition morphisms, determine explicit dimension formulas for the spaces of sections and their eigenspaces under the action of torsion groups, and apply this to specific models of elliptic curves with parametrized torsion subgroups.

 Fast integer multiplication using generalized Fermat primes
Svyatoslav Covanov 1 Emmanuel Thomé 1
Abstract : For almost 35 years, Schönhage-Strassen's algorithm has been the fastest algorithm known for multiplying integers, with a time complexity O(n⋅logn⋅log\relaxlogn)O(n⋅log⁡n⋅log⁡\relaxlog⁡n) for multiplying nn-bit inputs. In 2007, Fürer proved that there exists K>1K>1 and an algorithm performing this operation in O(n⋅logn⋅Klog∗n)O(n⋅log⁡n⋅Klog∗⁡n). Recent work by Harvey, van der Hoeven, and Lecerf showed that this complexity estimate can be improved in order to get K=8K=8, and conjecturally K=4K=4. We obtain here the same result K=4K=4 using simple modular arithmetic as a building block, and a careful complexity analysis. We obtain a similar result K=4K=4 using an alternative somewhat simpler algorithm, which relies on arithmetic modulo generalized Fermat primes.

 Algorithms on Ideal over Complex Multiplication order
Paul Kirchner
Abstract: We show in this paper that the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm for cyclotomic orders, previously revisited by Lenstra-Silverberg, can be extended to complex-multiplication (CM) orders, and even to a more general structure. This algorithm allows to test equality over the polarized ideal class group, and finds a generator of the polarized ideal in polynomial time. Also, the algorithm allows to solve the norm equation over CM orders and the recent reduction of principal ideals to the real suborder can also be performed in polynomial time. Furthermore, we can also compute in polynomial time a unit of an order of any number field given a (not very precise) approximation of it. Our description of the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm is different from the original and Lenstra- Silverberg’s variant and we hope the simplifications made will allow a deeper understanding. Finally, we show that the well-known speed-up for enumeration and sieve algorithms for ideal lattices over power of two cyclotomics can be generalized to any number field with many roots of unity.

 Still Wrong Use of Pairings in Cryptography
Mehmet Sabır Kiraz and Osmanbey Uzunkol
Abstract: Several pairing-based cryptographic protocols are recently proposed with a wide variety of new novel applications including the ones in emerging technologies like cloud computing, internet of things (IoT), e-health systems and wearable technologies. There have been however a wide range of incorrect use of these primitives. The paper of Galbraith, Paterson, and Smart (2006) pointed out most of the issues related to the incorrect use of pairing-based cryptography. However, we noticed that some recently proposed applications still do not use these primitives correctly. This leads to unrealizable, insecure or too inefficient designs of pairing-based protocols. We observed that one reason is not being aware of the recent advancements on solving the discrete logarithm problems in some groups. The main purpose of this article is to give an understandable, informative, and the most up-to-date criteria for the correct use of pairing-based cryptography. We thereby deliberately avoid most of the technical details and rather give special emphasis on the importance of the correct use of bilinear maps by realizing secure cryptographic protocols. We list a collection of some recent papers having wrong security assumptions or realizability/efficiency issues. Finally, we give a compact and an up-to-date recipe of the correct use of pairings.

 A theta expression of the Hilbert modular functions for 5‾√ via the periods of K3 surfaces
Atsuhira Nagano
    In this paper, we give an extension of the classical story of the elliptic modular function to the Hilbert modular case for ℚ(5‾√). We construct the period mapping for a family ={S(X,Y)} of K3 surfaces with 2 complex parameters X and Y. The inverse correspondence of the period mapping gives a system of generators of Hilbert modular functions for ℚ(5‾√).
    Moreover, we show an explicit expression of this inverse correspondence by theta constants.

Improving NFS for the discrete logarithm problem in non-prime finite fields
  Razvan Barbulescu and Pierrick Gaudry and Aurore Guillevic and François Morain
Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem in fields GF(pn) where n is a small integer greater than 1. Though less studied than the small characteristic case or the prime field case, the difficulty of this problem is at the heart of security evaluations for torus-based and pairing-based cryptography. The best known method for solving this problem is the Number Field Sieve (NFS). A key ingredient in this algorithm is the ability to find good polynomials that define the extension fields used in NFS. We design two new methods for this task, modifying the asymptotic complexity and paving the way for record-breaking computations. We exemplify these results with the computation of discrete logarithms over a field GF(p2) whose cardinality is 180 digits (595 bits) long.

 Post-quantum key exchange - a new hope
Erdem Alkim and Léo Ducas and Thomas Pöppelmann and Peter Schwabe
Abstract: At IEEE Security & Privacy 2015, Bos, Costello, Naehrig, and Stebila proposed an instantiation of Peikert's ring-learning-with-errors-based (Ring-LWE) key-exchange protocol (PQCrypto 2014), together with an implementation integrated into OpenSSL, with the affirmed goal of providing post-quantum security for TLS. In this work we revisit their instantiation and stand-alone implementation. Specifically, we propose new parameters and a better suited error distribution, analyze the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers in a conservative way, introduce a new and more efficient error-reconciliation mechanism, and propose a defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 9 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 24 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.

These problems were designed to prevent Jews and other undesirables from getting a passing grade. Among problems that were used by the department to blackball unwanted candidate students, these problems are distinguished by having a simple solution that is difficult to find. Using problems with a simple solution protected the administration from extra complaints and appeals. This collection therefore has mathematical as well as historical value.

 The transformation laws of algebraic theta functions
Luca Candelori
    We give a comprehensive treatment of the transformation laws of theta functions from an algebro-geometric perspective, that is, in terms of moduli of abelian schemes. This is accomplished by introducing geometric notions of theta-descent structures, metaplectic stacks, and bundles of half-forms, whose analytic incarnations underlie different aspects of the classical transformation laws. As an application, we lay the foundations for a geometric theory of modular forms of half-integral weight and, more generally, for modular forms taking values in the Weil representation. We discuss further applications to the algebraic theory of Jacobi forms and to the theory of determinant bundles of abelian schemes.

 On the Security of Supersingular Isogeny Cryptosystems
Steven D. Galbraith and Christophe Petit and Barak Shani and Yan Bo Ti
Abstract: We study cryptosystems based on supersingular isogenies. This is an active area of research in post-quantum cryptography. Our first contribution is to give a very powerful active attack on the supersingular isogeny encryption scheme. This attack can only be prevented by using a (relatively expensive) countermeasure proposed by Kirkwood et al. Our second contribution is to show that the security of all schemes of this type depends on the difficulty of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. This result gives significant insight into the difficulty of the isogeny problem that underlies the security of these schemes. Our third contribution is to give a reduction that uses partial knowledge of shared keys to determine an entire shared key. This can be used to retrieve the secret key, given information leaked from a side-channel attack on the key exchange protocol. A corollary of this work is the first bit security result for the supersingular isogeny key exchange: Computing any component of the j -invariant is as hard as computing the whole j -invariant.
Our paper therefore provides an improved understanding of the security of these cryptosystems. We stress that our work does not imply that these systems are insecure, or that they should not be used. However, it highlights that implementations of these schemes will need to take account of the risks associated with various active and side-channel attacks.

    The number of ``carries'' when n random integers are added forms a Markov chain [23]. We show that this Markov chain has the same transition matrix as the descent process when a deck of n cards is repeatedly riffle shuffled. This gives new results for the statistics of carries and shuffling.

    The "carries" when n random numbers are added base b form a Markov chain with an "amazing" transition matrix determined by Holte. This same Markov chain occurs in following the number of descents or rising sequences when n cards are repeatedly riffle shuffled. We give generating and symmetric function proofs and determine the rate of convergence of this Markov chain to stationarity. Similar results are given for type B shuffles. We also develop connections with Gaussian autoregressive processes and the Veronese mapping of commutative algebra.

 An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for a Variant of the Closest Lattice-Vector Problem
Lior Eldar, Peter W. Shor
    The Systematic Normal Form (SysNF) is a canonical form of lattices introduced in [Eldar,Shor '16], in which the basis entries satisfy a certain co-primality condition. Using a "smooth" analysis of lattices by SysNF lattices we design a quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve the following variant of the bounded-distance-decoding problem: given a lattice L, a vector v, and numbers b = {\lambda}_1(L)/n^{17}, a = {\lambda}_1(L)/n^{13} decide if v's distance from L is in the range [a/2, a] or at most b, where {\lambda}_1(L) is the length of L's shortest non-zero vector. Improving these parameters to a = b = {\lambda}_1(L)/\sqrt{n} would invalidate one of the security assumptions of the Learning-with-Errors (LWE) cryptosystem against quantum attacks.

 A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
Michael Betancourt
    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous under- standing of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important.
    In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.

 Efficient compression of SIDH public keys

https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/963
Craig Costello and David Jao and Patrick Longa and Michael Naehrig and Joost Renes and David Urbanik
Abstract: Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is an attractive candidate for post-quantum key exchange, in large part due to its relatively small public key sizes. A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo's original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.
In this paper, we propose a range of new algorithms and techniques that accelerate SIDH public-key compression by more than an order of magnitude, making it roughly as fast as a round of standalone SIDH key exchange, while further reducing the size of the compressed public keys by approximately 12.5%. These improvements enable the practical use of compression, achieving public keys of only 330 bytes for the concrete parameters used to target 128 bits of quantum security and further strengthens SIDH as a promising post-quantum primitive.

 Speeding up Huff Form of Elliptic Curves
Neriman Gamze Orhon and Huseyin Hisil
Abstract: This paper presents faster inversion-free point addition formulas for the curve y*(1+a*x^2)=c*x*(1+d*y^2). The proposed formulas improve the point doubling operation count record from 6M+5S to 8M and mixed-addition operation count record from 10M to 8M. Both sets of formulas are shown to be 4-way parallel, leading to an effective cost of 2M per either of the group operations.

 (Information) Paradox Lost
Tim Maudlin
    Since Stephen Hawking's original 1975 paper on black hole evaporation, there has been a consensus that the problem of "loss of information" is both deep and troubling. It is also thought that resolution of the problem may hold some conceptual keys to the unification of gravity with the other forces. I argue that this consensus view is mistaken. The so-called "information loss paradox" arises rather from the inaccurate application of foundational principles, involving both mathematical and conceptual errors. The resources for resolving the "paradox" are familiar and uncontroversial, as has been pointed out in the literature. The problem ought to have been dismissed 40 years ago. Recent radical attempts to solve the problem are blind alleys, solutions in search of a problem.

 How to (pre-)compute a ladder
Thomaz Oliveira and Julio López and Hüseyin Hışıl and Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez
Abstract: In the RFC 7748 memorandum, the Internet Research Task Force specified a Montgomery-ladder scalar multiplication function based on two recently adopted elliptic curves, ``curve25519" and ``curve448". The purpose of this function is to support the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm that will be included in the forthcoming version of the Transport Layer Security cryptographic protocol. In this paper, we describe a ladder variant that permits to accelerate the fixed-point multiplication function inherent to the Diffie-Hellman key pair generation phase. Our proposal combines a right-to-left version of the Montgomery ladder along with the pre-computation of constant values directly derived from the base-point and its multiples. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a Montgomery ladder procedure for prime elliptic curves that admits the extensive use of pre-computation. In exchange of very modest memory resources and a small extra programming effort, the proposed ladder obtains significant speedups for software implementations. Moreover, our proposal fully complies with the RFC 7748 specification. Our estimates suggest that a full implementation of our pre-computable ladder should outperform state-of-the-art software implementations of the X25519 and X448 functions by a 40\% speedup when working in the fixed-point scenario.

 Dissecting Ponzi schemes on Ethereum: identification, analysis, and impact
Massimo Bartoletti, Salvatore Carta, Tiziana Cimoli, Roberto Saia
    Ponzi schemes are financial frauds where, under the promise of high profits, users put their money, recovering their investment and interests only if enough users after them continue to invest money. Originated in the offline world 150 years ago, Ponzi schemes have since then migrated to the digital world, approaching first on the Web, and more recently hanging over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have provided a new opportunity for scammers, who have now the possibility of creating "trustworthy" frauds that still make users lose money, but at least are guaranteed to execute "correctly". We present a comprehensive survey of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum, analysing their behaviour and their impact from various viewpoints. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a remarkably high number of Ponzi schemes, despite the hosting platform has been operating for less than two years.

 Beating the bookies with their own numbers - and how the online sports betting market is rigged
Lisandro Kaunitz, Shenjun Zhong, Javier Kreiner
    The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers. Our results demonstrate that the football betting market is inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of games in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a detailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports gambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatory practices against successful clients.

Finite Fields and Their Applications, Distorting the volcano
Mireille Fouquet, Josep M. Miret, Javier Valera
Volcanoes of ℓ-isogenies of elliptic curves are a special case of graphs with a cycle called crater. In this paper, given an elliptic curve E of a volcano of ℓ-isogenies, we present a condition over an endomorphism φ of E in order to determine which ℓ-isogenies of E are non-descending. The endomorphism φ is defined as the crater cycle of an m-volcano where E is located, with $m\ne\ell$. The condition is feasible when φ is a distortion map for a subgroup of order ℓ of E. We also provide some relationships among the crater sizes of volcanoes of m-isogenies whose elliptic curves belong to a volcano of ℓ-isogenies.

 Yang-Mills Theory and the ABC Conjecture
Yang-Hui He, Zhi Hu, Malte Probst, James Read
    We establish a precise correspondence between the ABC Conjecture and N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory.
    This is achieved by combining three ingredients: (i) Elkies' method of mapping ABC-triples to elliptic curves in his demonstration that ABC implies Mordell/Faltings; (ii) an explicit pair of elliptic curve and associated Belyi map given by Khadjavi-Scharaschkin; and (iii) the fact that the bipartite brane-tiling/dimer model for a gauge theory with toric moduli space is a particular dessin d'enfant in the sense of Grothendieck.
    We explore this correspondence for the highest quality ABC-triples as well as large samples of random triples. The Conjecture itself is mapped to a statement about the fundamental domain of the toroidal compactification of the string realization of N=4 SYM.

 Trilinear maps for cryptography
Ming-Deh A. Huang
    We construct cryptographic trilinear maps that involve simple, non-ordinary abelian varieties over finite fields. In addition to the discrete logarithm problems on the abelian varieties, the cryptographic strength of the trilinear maps is based on a discrete logarithm problem on the quotient of certain modules defined through the N\'{e}ron-Severi groups. The discrete logarithm problem is reducible to constructing an explicit description of the algebra generated by two non-commuting endomorphisms, where the explicit description consists of a linear basis with the two endomorphisms expressed in the basis, and the multiplication table on the basis. It is also reducible to constructing an effective Z-basis for the endomorphism ring of a simple non-ordinary abelian variety. Both problems appear to be challenging in general and require further investigation.

 Plane quartics over Q with complex multiplication
Pinar Kilicer, Hugo Labrande, Reynald Lercier, Christophe Ritzenthaler, Jeroen Sijsling, Marco Streng
    We give examples of smooth plane quartics over Q with complex multiplication over Q¯¯¯¯ by a maximal order with primitive CM type. We describe the required algorithms as we go, these involve the reduction of period matrices, the fast computation of Dixmier-Ohno invariants, and reconstruction from these invariants. Finally, we discuss some of the reduction properties of the curves that we obtain.

 One Monad to Prove Them All (Functional Pearl)
Jan Christiansen, Sandra Dylus, Finn Teegen
(Submitted on 21 May 2018)
    One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventurous journey of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. In quest for a solution Mona goes on an educating journey through the land of functional programming. We follow her on her journey when she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq.
    These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem that has not been presented before. More precisely, Mona's final solution does not only work for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. That is, instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads. In the end of her journey Mona comes to the land of functional logic and the land of probabilistic programming. She learns that, because her proofs are monad-generic, they even hold in languages with other effects like non-determinism or probabilism.
    If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.

 Curves of genus 2 with group of automorphisms isomorphic to D_8 or D_12
Gabriel Cardona, Jordi Quer
(Submitted on 17 Mar 2002)
    In this paper we classify curves of genus 2 with group of automorphisms
    isomorphic to D_8 or D_12 over an arbitrary field k (of characteristic
    different from 2 in the D_8 case and from 2 and 3 in the D_{12} case)
    up to k-isomorphism. As an application of the classification of curves
    of genus 2 obtained, we get precise arithmetic information on their
    elliptic quotients and on their jacobians. Over the field k=Q, we show
    that the elliptic quotients of the curves with automorphisms D_8 and
    D_{12} are precisely the Q-curves of degrees 2 and 3, respectively, and
    we determine which curves have jacobians of GL_2-type.

Mapping $F_1$-land: an overview of geometries over the field with one element

Lundi 15 octobre, 10:30, Anand Kumar Narayanan (salle “Henri Poincaré”) :
Drinfeld Modules, Hasse Invariants and Factoring Polynomials over Finite
Fields.
Résumé :
We outline three novel algorithms to factor polynomials over finite fields
using the arithmetic of Drinfeld modules. The first algorithm estimates the
degree of an irreducible factor of a polynomial from Euler-Poincare
characteristics of random Drinfeld modules. Knowledge of a factor degree
allows one to rapidly extract all factors. The second algorithm is a random
Drinfeld module analogue of Berlekamp's algorithm, partly inspired by
Lenstra's elliptic curve method for integer factorization. The third algorithm
employs Drinfeld modules with complex multiplication and will be the primary
focus of the talk. The main idea is to compute a lift of the Hasse invariant
with Deligne's congruence playing a critical role. We will discuss practical
implementations and complexity theoretic implications of the algorithms. The
talk will be based on the papers https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00669 and
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07697 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00669>.
