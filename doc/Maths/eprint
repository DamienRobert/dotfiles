    Isogénies horizontales et classes d'isogénie de variétés abéliennes
    Nicolas Ratazzi (Submitted on 19 Nov 2012)
  The goal of this article is twofold. First we obtain a horizontal
  isogenies theorem (in the spirit of Frey-Jarden) for a certain (large)
  class of abelian varieties on a number field $K$. Secondly we apply this
  result in order to obtain a "radical caracterization", following
  Hall-Perucca, of the isogenies classes of abelian varieties in the
  preceeding class. Precisely we obtain a result for the abelian varieties
  faithfully of type GSp, a class containing the abelian varieties A/K of
  dimension 2 or odd and generic (such that the endomorphism ring is Z).

 On a generalization of Deuring's results Ken-ichi Sugiyama
     Using the Dieudonne theory we will study a reduction of an abelian
     variety of complex multiplication. Our results may be regarded as a
     generalization of a classical theorem due to Deuring for a CM-elliptic
     curve. We will also discuss a sufficient condition that is a proper
     smooth curve with CM to be maximal.

 Integral Tate modules and splitting of primes in torsion fields of elliptic curves
  Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $k$, and $\ell$ a
  prime number different from the characteristic of $k$. In this paper
  we consider the problem of finding the structure of the Tate module
  $T_\ell(E)$ as an {\it integral} Galois representations of $k$. We
  show that the characteristic polynomial of the arithmetic Frobenius
  and the $j$-invariant of $E$ suffice to this purpose in almost all
  cases. Hilbert Class Polynomials of imaginary quadratic orders play
  an important role. We give an application to the splitting of primes
  in torsion fields arising from elliptic curves over number fields.

 Frobenius lifts and point counting for smooth curves
 Amnon Besser, François-Renaud Escriva, Rob de Jeu
     We describe an algorithm to compute the zeta-function of a proper,
     smooth curve over a finite field, when the curve is given together
     with some auxiliary data. Our method is based on computing the matrix
     of the action of a semi-linear Frobenius on the first cohomology group
     of the curve by means of Serre duality. The cup product involved can
     be computed locally, after first computing local expansions of a
     globally defined lift of Frobenius. The resulting algorithm's
     complexity is softly cubic in the field degree, which is also the case
     with Kedlaya's algorithm in the hyperelliptic case.

 On the number of elliptic curves with prescribed isogeny or torsion group over number fields of prime degree
 Filip Najman
   Let $p$ be a prime and $K$ a number field of degree $p$. We count the
   number of elliptic curves, up to $\bar{K}$-isomorphism, having a
   prescribed property, where this property is either that the curve
   contains a fixed torsion group as a subgroup, or that it has an isogeny
   of prescribed degree. We also study the following question: for a given
   $n$ such that $|Y_0(n)(\Q)|>0$, does every elliptic curve over $K$ with
   an $n$-isogeny have a quadratic twist with torsion $\Z/n\Z$ as a
   subgroup? We prove that this is true only for the cases $n=2,3,4,6$ and
   for the pairs $(n,K)=(11, \Q(\zeta_{11})^+)$ and $(n,K)=(14,
   \Q(\zeta_{7})^+)$.

  Exploiting Collisions in Addition Chain-based Exponentiation Algorithms
  Neil Hanley and HeeSeok Kim and Michael Tunstall
    Abstract: Public key cryptographic algorithms are typically based on group
    exponentiation algorithms, and many algorithms have been proposed in the
    literature based on addition chains. We describe attacks based on
    collisions of variables manipulated in group operations extending attacks
    described in the literature. These collisions are visible where one is able
    to acquire information through some suitable side channel that provides a
    trace during the computation of a group exponentiation algorithm. For
    example, through measuring the instantaneous power consumption or the
    electromagnetic emanations of a microprocessor. The advantage of our
    attacks over previous work is that the attacks can be applied to a single
    trace and do not require any knowledge of the input to the exponentiation
    algorithm. Moreover, we prove that our attacks are applicable to all
    addition chain-based exponentiation algorithms. This means that a side
    channel resistant implementation of a group exponentiation will require
    countermeasures that introduce enough noise that an attack is not
    practical.

 Index conditions and cup-product maps on abelian varieties
    We study questions surrounding cup-product maps which arise from
    pairs of non-degenerate line bundles on an abelian variety. Important
    to our work is Mumford's index theorem which we use to prove that
    non-degenerate line bundles exhibit positivity analogous to that of
    ample line bundles. As an application we determine the asymptotic
    behaviour of families of cup-product maps and prove that vector
    bundles associated to these families are asymptotically globally
    generated. To illustrate our results we provide several examples. For
    instance, we construct families of cup-product problems which result
    in a zero map on a one dimensional locus. We also prove that the
    hypothesis of our results can be satisfied, in all possible
    instances, by a particular class of simple abelian varieties.
    Finally, we discuss the extent to which Mumford's theta groups are
    applicable in our more general setting.
