Residue Theorem
===============

if X is a compact Riemann surface, and f holomorphic then
\sum_residues Res(f) = 0.

Application: \sum mult(f) = 0  [look at df/f]

Morphism to projective space
============================

If f: X -> Y is a map of compact Riemann surfaces, then
deg f^* D = deg f deg D.

If D is a divisor without base point, |D| of dimension n, then we get a
morphism
f: X -> P^{n-1}.
Geometrically, the divisors in |D| correspond to the pullback of the
hyperplanes via f.

Coordinate free: the map f is given by
x -> { E \in |D| | E >= (x) } \in P(|D|)*
    Indeed, this set is a hyperplane in |D|, more precisely under the
    bijection between |D| and P(L(D)) it corresponds to P(L(D-x))

Linear pencils (= dimension 1):
--------------

a map X -> P^1 correspond to a meromorphic function f.
Reciprocally, D=Div(f)_{\infty} has elements of L(D) given by (1,f), which
give the previous map (up to an inversible constant).

The corresponding subspace of |Div f| is then 
{div (1)} \join {div (f-c), c \in \C}, this is a "trivial"
pencil, corresponding to f*((c)-(\infty)).

Rem: Div(f) is simply f*( (0)-(\infty) ), so it is of degree 0.
We could replace (0)-(\infty)=Div(X) by any divisor D=\sum n_i (P_i) of
degree 0. D corresponds to \prod (X-P_i)^n_i, so f^* D correspond to
div (f(X)-P_i)^n_i
