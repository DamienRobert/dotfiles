There are a few properties from Hartshorne IV on curves that I am trying to
verify. Let D be an effective divisor on a curve (integral scheme of
dimension 1, proper over k, regular) X, dim|D|=1, and f the induced
morphism to P1.

The degree of D is the degree of f, where deg(f)=[K(X):K(P1)].
In lemma IV.4.2, Hartshorne seems to claim that all points in the support
of D are in the same fiber.
Again in lemma IV.4.2, Hartshorne seems to claim that if [K(X):K(P1)] is
Galois, then an automorphism of the Galois group permutes elements of the
fiber.

Your first question is already answered. For the second, by definition,
f(P)=D′ where D′ is the unique effective divisor linearly equivalent to D
with D′≥P. So it is clear that f(P)=D if P is in the support of D. The
third question is similarly straightforward. – Felipe Voloch Oct 10 '11 at

Ah this makes so much more sense! I was not aware of the "definition" you
mentioned; if it's in Hartshorne then I missed it. So for the third, the
action of a Galois element fixes the elements of P1, which I'm identifying
with effective divisors linearly equivalent to D. Since these divisors also
define the fibers of my map, it must be that the fibers are permuted. –
