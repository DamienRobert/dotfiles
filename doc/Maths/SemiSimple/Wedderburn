Algèbres Semi Simples
=====================

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin%E2%80%93Wedderburn_theorem

An (Artinian [en particulière une K-alg de dim finie]) semisimple ring R is
isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings over
division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely
determined up to permutation of the index i. In particular, any simple left
or right Artinian ring is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over a
division ring D, where both n and D are uniquely determined.

It follows from the Jordan–Hölder theorem that, while the decomposition
into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations may not be unique, the
irreducible pieces have well-defined multiplicities. In particular, a
representation of a finite group over a field of characteristic zero is
determined up to isomorphism by its character.

Ex: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschke%27s_theorem
    Maschke's Theorem. Let G be a finite group and K a field whose characteristic does not divide the order of G. Then K[G], the group algebra of G, is semisimple.
    De manière équivalente les G-modules sont semi-simples.

    Theorem. C[G] ≅ \sum_V \bar{V}\otimes_G V where the sum is taken over the inequivalent G-irreducible representations V.

A centrale simple sur K, alors A= M_n(S), S à division.
(centrale/K veut dire que Z(A)=K)
S à division, k corps maximal inclus dans S, alors
S est de dim m^2 sur k et S \tens k = M_m(S) (ie k splitting field de A).

Indice A := Degree S := m.
Exposant A=Ordre(S) dans le groupe de Brauer.
Exposant A | Indice A.

- If S is a simple subalgebra of a central simple algebra A then dim_K S divides dim-K A.
- If D is a central division algebra over K for which the index has prime factorisation
    indice(D) = \prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{m_i}
  then D has a tensor product decomposition
     D = \otimes_{i=1}^r D_i
  where each component Di is a central division algebra of index p_i^{m_i},
  and the components are uniquely determined up to isomorphism.


* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem%E2%80%93Noether_theorem

Let A and B be simple rings, and let k be the centre of B.
Suppose further that the dimension of B over k is finite, i.e. that B is a
central simple algebra. Then given k-algebra homomorphisms
    f, g : A → B
there exists a unit b in B such that for all a in A[1][2]
    g(a) = b · f(a) · b^−1.
In particular, every automorphism of a central simple k-algebra is an inner
automorphism.

Ex: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur%27s_lemma
If M and N are two simple modules over a ring R, then any homomorphism f: M
→ N of R-modules is either invertible or zero. In particular, the
endomorphism ring of a simple module is a division ring.

Schur's lemma is frequently applied in the following particular case. Suppose that R is an algebra over the field C of complex numbers and M = N is a finite-dimensional simple module over R. Then Schur's lemma says that the endomorphism ring of the module M is a division ring; this division ring contains C in its center, is finite-dimensional over C and is therefore equal to C. Thus the endomorphism ring of the module M is "as small as possible".
ie si V G-irréd, End_G(V)=\C.

Generalisation: A module is said to be strongly indecomposable if its endomorphism ring is a local ring. For the important class of modules of finite length, the following properties are equivalent (Lam 2001, §19):
  -  A module M is indecomposable;
  -  M is strongly indecomposable;
  -  Every endomorphism of M is either nilpotent or invertible.
