Morita Equivalence
==================

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morita_equivalence

The ring of n-by-n matrices with elements in R, denoted Mn(R), is Morita-equivalent to R for any n > 0

For every right-exact functor F from the category of left-R modules to the
category of left-S modules that commutes with direct sums, a theorem of
homological algebra shows that there is a (S,R)-bimodule E such that the
functor {F}(-) is naturally isomorphic to the functor E
\otimes_R -. Since equivalences are by necessity exact and commute with
direct sums, this implies that R and S are Morita equivalent if and only if
there are bimodules RMS and SNR such that M \otimes_{S} N \cong R as (R,R)
bimodules and N \otimes_{R} M \cong S as (S,S) bimodules. Moreover, N and M
are related via an (S,R) bimodule isomorphism: N \cong
\operatorname{Hom}(M_S,S_S).

If F(-) is the equivalence functor from R-Mod to S-Mod, then the R module M
has any of the following properties if and only if the S module F(M) does:
injective, projective, flat, faithful, simple, semisimple, finitely
generated, finitely presented, Artinian, and Noetherian. Examples of
properties not necessarily preserved include being free, and being cyclic.

Many ring theoretic properties are stated in terms of their modules, and so these properties are preserved between Morita equivalent rings. Properties shared between equivalent rings are called Morita invariant properties. For example, a ring R is semisimple if and only if all of its modules are semisimple, and since semisimple modules are preserved under Morita equivalence, an equivalent ring S must also have all of its modules semisimple, and therefore be a semisimple ring itself.

Sometimes it is not immediately obvious why a property should be preserved. For example, using one standard definition of von Neumann regular ring (for all a in R, there exists x in R such that a = axa) it is not clear that an equivalent ring should also be von Neumann regular. However another formulation is: a ring is von Neumann regular if and only if all of its modules are flat. Since flatness is preserved across Morita equivalence, it is now clear that von Neumann regularity is Morita invariant.

The following properties are Morita invariant:
    simple, semisimple
    von Neumann regular
    right (or left) Noetherian, right (or left) Artinian
    right (or left) self-injective
    quasi-Frobenius
    prime, right (or left) primitive, semiprime, semiprimitive
    right (or left) (semi-)hereditary
    right (or left) nonsingular
    right (or left) coherent
    semiprimary, right (or left) perfect, semiperfect
    semilocal
Examples of properties which are not Morita invariant include commutative, local, reduced, domain, right (or left) Goldie, Frobenius, invariant basis number, and Dedekind finite.
