There is another obvious obstruction: by definition two twists are isomorphics above an extension, but are not isomorphic above their field of definition (and also not isogenous).

I believe that these are the only two obstructions, meaning that if (1) there exist a K-rational isogeny f:A→B and (2) End0L(A)=End0K(A) then every L-isogeny A→B is in fact K-rational.

Indeed, since there exist a K-isogeny, the ℚ-rank r of End0K(A) is the same as End0K(B), and this is also the same as the ℤ-rank of HomK(A,B) (the module of K-isogenies), since the endomorphism ring is an order in its endomorphism algebra and HomK(A,B) is not empty. Now by hypothesis (2), we have also that the ℤ-rank of HomL(A,B) is of rank r. Since HomK(A,B)⊂HomL(A,B) are of same rank, for every L-isogeny g:A→B there exist m such that mg is K-rational. Since mg=gm is K-rational and m is K-rational, there exist a K-rational isogeny g2 such that gm=g2m by the universal property of isogenies. But then m(g−g2)=0 which mean that g=g2 and our isogeny g was in fact K-rational.

In fact Shimura handled the case of an abelian variety A with complex multiplication by an order O inside the maximal order OK of the CM field K. A very good modern reference is the following article by Marco Streng: An explicit version of Shimura's reciprocity law for Siegel modular functions. I also recommend his PhD thesis. Both are available here: http://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~strengtc/research.html

Now for the statement (see Theorem 2.2 of the paper above): let τ be the element of the Siegel space that corresponds to the abelian variety A above. The Siegel modular functions of level N with q-expansion in ℚ(ζN) evaluated at τ generate an abelian extension H(N) of the reflex field Kr (for the type norm Φ associated to A).

This abelian extension is associated by class field theory to the class group IK(NF)/HΦ,O(N) where

    F is the conductor of O
    IK(NF) are the fractional ideals of K prime to NF
    HΦ,O(N) are the ideals 𝔞∈IK(NF) such that ∃μ∈K with NΦr,O(𝔞)=μO, μμ⎯⎯=N(𝔞)∈ℚ and μ≡1mod×NO. (Here NΦr,O is the type norm from the reflex field Kr to K.)

Now specializing to elliptic curves, we get that

    If E has CM by OK, then K(j(E),h(E[𝔪])) is the ray class field associated to the class group IK(m)/{μOK∣μ≡1mod×m}
    If E has CM by O where the conductor of O is F∈ℤ, then K(j(E)) is the ring class field of O, meaning the extension associated to the class group IK(F)/{principal ideals primes to F}. And finally, K(j(E),h(E[𝔪])) will correspond to IK(mF)/{μOK∣μ is prime to F and μ≡1mod×m}. (At least we have the inclusion, but I am pretty sure that in the elliptic curve case, the evaluation of Weber functions at the points of m-torsion over the j-invariant give the field generated by level-m modular forms evaluated at τ.) So in this case we have something intermediate between a ring class field and a ray class field. [I have not checked carefully but it should be the compositium of the ring class field of conductor F and the ray class field of modulus m when m is prime to F].

# My Questions
## http://mathoverflow.net/questions/140046/what-are-the-local-properties-of-scheme-preserved-under-global-sections

What are the local properties of scheme preserved under global sections?

Let (P) be a property of rings. I call (P) local when (P) satisfy these two
conditions:
- if A is a ring satisfying (P), then the distinguished rings A_f also
  satisfy (P).
- If Spec A is covered by distinguished open Spec A_i with the A_i having
  (P), then A satisfy (P).

Now if (P) is local, then it is natural to extend the property (P) to
schemes by saying that a scheme X has property (P) iff for all open affines
Spec A of X, A has property (P).

By definition of locality, then
- a ring A satisfy (P) iff Spec A satisfy (P)
- a scheme X satisfy (P) iff X can be covered by affines open Spec A_i with
  A_i satisfying (P)

Likewise in the relative setting, local properties of morphisms of rings
allow to define a corresponding notion for morphisms of schemes.

[I have to point out that sometimes extending a local property (P) of rings
to schemes this way is called (locally P), and a scheme X is said to have
property (P) when X is locally P and satisfy some finiteness condition.
For instance X is noetherian when it is locally noetherian and
quasi-compact; a morphism is of finite presentation when it is locally of
finite presentation and quasi-compact + quasi-separated.]

Now while this is a standard construction explained in all textbooks, it is
harder to find references for what happen to the global section of non
affine open subschemes.

Indeed, if X has a local property (P), then an open scheme U has also
property (P), but Spec O_X(U) may not have (P) when U is not affine.

For instance:
- X is noetherian does not mean that each ring of sections O_X(U) is
  noetherian
  (An example is given by the union of two disjoints plane in projective
  space P^3_k
  cf http://sma.epfl.ch/~ojangure/nichtnoethersch.pdf)
- X is finitely generated (say over a field) does not mean that each
  ring of sections O_X(U) is finitely generated
  (Same example as above, see also http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/files/nonfg.pdf)
- X -> Spec A is flat does not mean that O_X(X) is flat over A.
  (cf http://mathoverflow.net/questions/65267/global-sections-of-flat-scheme-also-flat)

However there are properties that hold for sections over any open subschemes:
- If X is reduced, then for every open subscheme U, O_X(U) is reduced
- If X is integral, then for every open subscheme U, O_X(U) is integral

I am interested to what happen with other properties (P). I am also
interested to what happen in the relative case: if a morphism X->Y has
property (P), then does Spec_Y(X) -> Y also has (P)?

## http://mathoverflow.net/questions/163041/non-split-extension-isomorphic-as-a-group-to-a-split-extension

Let A be a finite abelian group and G a finite group acting on A. Then the extension 0→A→E→G→1 is splits if and only if the corresponding 2-cocycle is trivial in H2(G,A).

Does there exist such a split extension E such that E can also be seen as a non split extension (for the same action of G on A)? Or in other words, can we find two groups G and A, and an action of G on A such that there exists α1,α2∈H2(G,A) which corresponds to the same group E, and with α1=0?

With help from user gro-tsen, I can say the following:

    In the answer here: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/131881/group-extensions/131895#131895 one can find two extensions of G=(ℤ/pℤ)2 by A=(ℤ/pℤ)2, isomorphic as groups, and one splits and the other not. Unfortunately the action by G on A is different, so this does not quite answer my question.

    In the answer here: Extensions isomorphic as groups but not congruent or pseudo-congruent one can find that there exist non pseudo congruent extensions (but isomorphic as groups), even for the trivial action, even for an abelian extension E. But in this example none of the two extensions split.

    In fact if E is abelian, it can't be both a split and a non split extension of G by A. This is a special case of Can a module be an extension in two really different ways?

  #Very nice answer by BConrad:
  #General Principle: If everything used can be "described" with only finitely many elements of the base ring, the objects all descend to a noetherian subring (such as Z-subalgebra generated by the finitely many elements used in the "description") and if we increase it a bit the morphisms also descend (need to kill off some relations), and if we increase it some more we can also descend all "reasonable" properties (flatness, smoothness, radiciel, surjectivity, etc.). This last step is by far the most subtle (for things like flatness). In the end, it always comes down to the fact that if something vanishes in a direct limit then it vanishes somewhere always the way, and if a direct limit of rings is 0 then the rings eventually vanish (track whether or not 1=0).

  If I is invariant par the Galois group G(K/k) then it is defined by
  polynomials in k[x_i]. This is standard Galois descent, but the proof
  given is interesting:
  Then G acts k-linearly on each I_d, and each I_d is a finite-dimensional
  K-vector space, say of dimension m_d. According to the multi-variable
  Hilbert 90 theorem, the non-abelian cohomology H^1(G,GL_m_d(K)) vanishes,
  and this implies by the usual argument that the map I^G_d⊗_k K→I_d is
  surjective, i.e. I_d has a basis B_d defined over k.
  Note: sur un corps parfait, X \subset A^n ou P^n est invariant par Galois
  <=> Ideal(X) est généré par des polynômes définis sur k <=> X=Var(ideal
  défini par des polynômes sur k). Cf par exemple Hindry-Silverman Exo A.1.13

  Smooth/Etale/Unramified = formally foo + loc. finite pres.
  Formally foo: requires lift for affine schemes
  Formally etale/unramified -> has lift for arbitrary scheme (since the lift on the affine is unique, it glues together).
  If loc. finite pres: suffice to check lift for local artinian rings
  Still works for formally étale/unramified.
  For formally smooth: Zariski locally formally smooth => formally smooth because being projective is an fpqc local condition, so formally smooth is even an étale local condition on the source

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/133341/which-categories-are-the-categories-of-models-of-a-lawvere-theory/133343#133343
 A category C is equivalent to the category of models for a (finitary) Lawvere theory in Set
 if and only if it satisfies these conditions:
 - C is locally small and cocomplete.
 - There exists a small family G of objects in C such that, for every
   object G in G, the hom-functor C(G,−):C→Set preserves sifted colimits,
   and for every object A in C, there exists a small sifted diagram of
   objects in G whose colimit in C is A.
These conditions are easily seen to be analogues of the conditions for C to
be locally finitely presentable, except for replacing "filtered" (or
"directed") everywhere by "sifted". Incidentally, any such C is locally
finitely presentable, and we may also replace "cocomplete" in condition (1)
with "complete", just as for locally finitely presentable categories.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/191575/what-is-the-consistency-strength-of-a-standard-model-of-zf-versus-a-transitive-m
  # What precisely do you mean by a standard model? An ω-model? (That is, a
  # model whose set of natural numbers is isomorphic to ω.) Or a β-model?
  # (That is, a model whose ordinals are well-ordered.)
  # If the latter, the Mostowski collapse theorem tells us any such model is
  # isomorphic in a unique way to a unique transitive model. If the former, the
  # existence of an ω-model has consistency strength strictly weaker than the
  # existence of a transitive one. (This follows, for instance, from
  # absoluteness considerations: Any transitive model of ZF has as elements
  # some ω-models.)
  # It is true that there are β-models whose ordinals do not form an
  # initial segment of the true ordinals, even if the membership relation
  # of the model is true membership. For instance, if Vα is a model of set
  # theory, consider any of its countable elementary substructures.
  # Note that models whose membership relation is true membership are β
  # -models, so they are isomorphic, via the collapse, to transitive
  # models. The point of the Mostowski collapse is that there is a natural
  # rank that we can assign to the elements of a standard model M.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostowski_collapse_lemma
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/33688/zfc-exists-standard-model-rightarrow-conzfc-exists-omega-model/33708#33708
  ZFC+∃Vα model of ZFC⊢Con(ZFC+∃ transitive standard model of ZFC)
  ZFC+∃ transitive standard model of ZFC⊢Con(ZFC+∃ω−model of ZFC)
  # For part 2: The statement "There is an ω-model of ZFC" is Σ11: Note that
  # if there is an ω-model, there is a countable one (take a countable
  # elementary substructure), and now we can express this by saying that
  # "there is a real x coding a model of ZFC, and there is a real y coding an
  # order isomorphism of ω onto the natural numbers of the model coded by x".
  # Mostowski's absoluteness theorem gives us that any transitive model of
  # ZFC is correct about Σ11 statements (see Section 13 of Kanamori's book,
  # for example). In particular, your transitive model is a model of the
  # statement that there is an ω-model.

- https://mathoverflow.net/questions/21492/stacks-in-the-zariski-topology/21500
  If you have groupoid objects (which means that certain pullbacks need to exist), you can look at those stacks arising as torsors of groupoid objects (these will be the stackification of pseudo-functors of the form Hom( ,G)). Whether or not these deserve to be called Artin stacks in general may indeed be contentious, but this is why I used quotation marks. I agree that you will need additional axioms for these "Artin stacks" to be equivalent to a bicategory of groupoids and torsors,

  #Theorem. Let X be a connected topological space, A⊆X a connected subset and C a component of X∖A. Then X∖C is connected.
  #Another proof here: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/187145/strengthening-of-a-kuratowskis-theorem-about-connected-sets?lq=1 which present the following corrollaries:
  #(b) If {A_k:k=1,…,m} and {B_k:k=1,…,n} are finite families of connected sets, and ⋃A_k∪ ⋃B_k is connected, then there are i∈{1,…,m} and j∈{1,…,n} such that A_i∪B_j is connected.
  #(c) If {A_k:k=0,…,n} is a finite family of connected sets such that ⋃A_k is connected, then the sets A_1,…,A_n can be re-indexed so that A_0∪⋃_{k<=m} A_k is connected for m=1,…,n.
