In algebraic group theory, approximation theorems are an extension of the
Chinese remainder theorem to algebraic groups G over global fields k. They
give conditions for the group G(k) to be dense in a restricted direct
product of groups of the form G(ks) for ks a completion of k at the place
s. In weak approximation theorems the product is over a finite set of
places s, while in strong approximation theorems the product is over all
but a finite set of places.

So fix pairwise nonequivalent absolute values {\left|\cdot\right|_1, \dots,
\left|\cdot\right|_n} on the field {K}; this means that they induce
different topologies, so are not powers of each other. 

Theorem 1 (Artin-Whaples)
Hypotheses as above, given {a_1, \dots, a_n \in K} and {\epsilon>0},
there exists {a \in K} with
\left|a - a_i\right|_i < \epsilon, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n.

Theorem 3
  Let {K} be a field with a discrete valuation {v} (yes, this is a change of notation), and let {L} be a finite extension with {w} the valuations on {L} prolonging {v}. Then

  \prod_w L_w \simeq L \otimes_K K_v.

Theorem 20.4.4 (Strong Approximation)   Let $v_0$ be any normalized
nontrivial valuation of the global field $K$. Let $\AA_{K,v_0}$ be the
restricted topological product of the $K_v$ with respect to the $\O_v$,
where $v$ runs through all normalized valuations $v \neq v_0$. Then $K$
is dense in $\AA _{K,v_0}$.

Lemma 20.4.1   There is a constant $ C>0$ that depends only on the global
field $K$ with the following property:
Whenever $\mathbf{x}=\{x_v\}_v \in \AA_K$ is such that
$\prod_v |x_v|_v > C$
then there is a nonzero principal adele $a \in K \subset \AA_K$ such that
$|a|_v \leq |x_v|_v$ for all $v$.

more elementeray proofs given here)
