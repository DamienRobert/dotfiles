Neukirch.
L/K extension, K non archimedian henselian.

Unramificatied case
===================

T: maximal unramified extension in L.
Then t (residual field) is the separable subfield of l/k.
Valuation(T)=Valuation(K).

In particular, the maximal unramified extension K_nr of K_bar has the roots
of unity of order m not divisibles by car k. If k is finite, as kbar/k is
generated by these roots, K_nr is too.

Tame ramification
=================
(ramification modérée)

L/K is tamely ramified iff
L=T(a_i^{1/m_i}) where (m_i,p)=1
In this case we always have [L:K]=ef

Let V be the maximal tamely ramified ext in L.
Then v is the separable subfield of l/k.
Valuation(V*)=Valuation(L*)^(p) (=the elements of Valuation(L^*) whose
order modulo Valuation(K*) is prime to p).

Summary
=======

K \subset T \subset V   \subset L
k \subset l_s  =    l_s \subset l
v(K*)  =  w(T*)   w(L*)^(p)   w(L*)

- The subextensions of T/K correspond 1-1 to the subextensions of l_s/k
- The subextensions of V/T correspond 1-1 to the subgroups of w(V*)/w(T*).

Cyclotomic extension
====================

Let \zeta_n be a primitive n-th root of unity, with n=dp^m.
We have
\Q_p \subset T=\Q_p(\zeta_d) \subset V=T(\zeta_p) \subset \Q_p(\zeta_n)
