A Kummer extension is a field extension L/K, where for some given integer n > 1 we have
- K contains n distinct nth roots of unity (i.e., roots of X^n-1)
- L/K has abelian Galois group of exponent n.

Kummer theory: if K has n distinc nth roots of unity, then
abelian extensions of K of exponent n correspond bijectively with subgroups
of
    K^{\times}/K^{\times,n}
via the correspondance
    \Delta -> K(\Delta^{1/n})
and reciproqly L -> \Delta K^{\times} \inter L^{\times,n} \iso Hom(Gal(L/K), \mu_n)
