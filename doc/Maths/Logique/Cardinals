A) Cofinalité
The cofinality of an ordinal α is the smallest ordinal δ which is the order
type of a cofinal subset of α. It is a cardinal.

More generally: the cofinality cf(A) of a partially ordered set A is the
least of the cardinalities of the cofinal subsets of A.

If cf(alpha)=alpha then alpha is called regular. It is then a cardinal. cf
o cf = cf, so the cofinality is regular. 

Si alpha successeur ou 0, Aleph_alpha est régulier, sinon on a
cf(Aleph_alpha)=cf(alpha), donc si Aleph_alpha est régulier alors on a un
point fixe (mais la réciproque est fausse: le point fixe
Aleph_Aleph_Aleph... a cofinalité w_0).

- Si A unbounded dans gamma, alors cf(gamma)=cf(type(A))
- cf(a+b)=cf(b). Si A limite < w_2, alors cf(A)=w_0 ou w_1
- pour un cardinal kappa infini, cf(kappa) est le plus petit ordinal alpha tel
  que kappa s'écrit comme somme de alpha cardinaux < kappa

Rem: cardinal exponentiation: 
si 2<=kappa<=2^lamba, alors kappa^lambda=2^lambda

GRANDS CARDINAUX
===============

1) Un cardinal limite est faiblement innaccessible s'il est régulier.
En particulier, kappa faiblement innaccessible implique qu'il est le
kappa-ième point fixe de Aleph.

2) Un ordinal kappa fortement innaccessible est un ordinal faiblement
   innaccessible qui est en plus fortement limite (ie 2^lambda < kappa pour
   tout lambda < kappa). Sous l'hypothèse du continu généralisée 2)
   coincide avec 1)

Ex, si kappa est fortement innaccessible, V_kappa est un modèle (du second
ordre) de ZFC, Delta_0(V_kappa) est un modèle de Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel
(on a le droit de parler de classes, mais le principe de comprehension est
restreint à des ensembles, c'est une extension conservative de ZFC), et
V_kappa+1 est un modèle de Morse–Kelley  (là on a un schéma de
compréhension où les variables peuvent être des classes).

Innaccessible cardinals are Pi^1_0-indescriptilbe

3) A cardinal κ is α-inaccessible, for α any ordinal, if and only if κ is
inaccessible and for every ordinal β < α, the set of β-inaccessibles less
than κ is unbounded in κ (and thus of cardinality κ, since κ is regular).

The α-inaccessible cardinals can be equivalently described as fixed points
of functions which count the lower inaccessibles. For example, denote by
ψ0(λ) the λth inaccessible cardinal, then the fixed points of ψ0 are the
1-inaccessible cardinals. Then letting ψβ(λ) be the λth β-inaccessible
cardinal, the fixed points of ψβ are the (β+1)-inaccessible cardinals (the
values ψβ+1(λ)). If α is a limit ordinal, an α-inaccessible is a fixed
point of every ψβ for β < α (the value ψα(λ) is the λth such cardinal).
This process of taking fixed points of functions generating successively
larger cardinals is commonly encountered in the study of large cardinal
numbers.

κ is hyperincasseible if κ is κ-inaccessible. 
For any ordinal α, a cardinal κ is α-hyper-inaccessible if and only if κ is
hyper-inaccessible and for every ordinal β < α, the set of
β-hyper-inaccessibles less than κ is unbounded in κ.

4) A cardinal number κ is called Mahlo if κ is inaccessible and the set U =
   {λ < κ: λ is inaccessible} is stationary in κ.

   A cardinal κ is called weakly Mahlo if κ is weakly inaccessible and the
   set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ is stationary in κ.

5) Reflecting cardinal
A reflecting cardinal is a
cardinal number κ for which there is a normal ideal I on κ such that for
every X∈I+, the set of α∈κ for which X reflects at α is in I+. (A
stationary subset S of κ is said to reflect at α<κ if S∩α is stationary in
α.) Reflecting cardinals were introduced by (Mekler & Shelah 1989).

6) Formally, a cardinal κ is defined to be weakly compact if it is
   uncountable and for every function f: [κ] 2 → {0, 1} there is a set of
   cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f. In this context, [κ] 2 means
   the set of 2-element subsets of κ, and a subset S of κ is homogeneous
   for f if and only if either all of [S]2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to
   1.

Equivalently: 
- κ is inaccessible and has the tree property, that is, every
tree of height κ has either a level of size κ or a branch of size κ.
- κ is \Pi^1_1-indescribable.
- κ is κ-unfoldable.

-> Πm n-indescribable, totally indescribable cardinals

7) λ-unfoldable, unfoldable cardinals, ν-indescribable cardinals and
   λ-shrewd, shrewd cardinals [not clear how these relate to each other].

- Formally, a cardinal number κ is λ-unfoldable if and only if for every
transitive model M of cardinality κ of ZFC-minus-power set such that κ is
in M and M contains all its sequences of length less than κ, there is a
non-trivial elementary embedding j of M into a transitive model with the
critical point of j being κ and j(κ) ≥ λ.

A cardinal is unfoldable if and only if it is an λ-unfoldable for all
ordinals λ.

- A cardinal number κ is called λ-shrewd if for every proposition φ, and set
A ⊆ Vκ with (Vκ+λ, ∈, A) ⊧ φ there exists an α, λ' < κ with (Vα+λ', ∈, A ∩
Vα) ⊧ φ. It is called shrewd if it is λ-shrewd for every λ (including λ >
κ).

This definition extends the concept of indescribability to transfinite
levels. A λ-shrewd cardinal is also μ-shrewd for any ordinal μ < λ.
Shrewdness was developed by Michael Rathjen as part of his ordinal analysis
of Π12-comprehension. It is essentially the nonrecursive analog to the
stability property for admissible ordinals.

8) ethereal cardinals, subtle cardinals

A cardinal κ is called subtle if for every closed and unbounded C ⊂ κ and
for every sequence A of length κ for which element number δ (for an
arbitrary δ), Aδ ⊂ δ there are α, β, belonging to C, with α<β, such that
Aα=Aβ∩α. A cardinal κ is called ethereal if for every closed and unbounded
C ⊂ κ and for every sequence A of length κ for which element number δ (for
an arbitrary δ), Aδ ⊂ δ and Aδ has the same cardinal as δ, there are α, β,
belonging to C, with α<β, such that card(α)=card(Aβ∩Aα).

9) almost ineffable, ineffable, n-ineffable, totally ineffable cardinals

A cardinal number \kappa is called ineffable if for every binary-valued
function f : \mathcal{P}_{=2}(\kappa) \to \{0,1\}, there is a stationary
subset of \kappa on which f is homogeneous: that is, either f maps all
unordered pairs of elements drawn from that subset to zero, or it maps all
such unordered pairs to one.

10) remarkable cardinals

11) α-Erdős cardinals (for countable α), 0# (not a cardinal), γ-Erdős cardinals
(for uncountable γ)

- The Erdős cardinal κ(α) is defined to be the least cardinal such that for
every function f: κ<ω → {0, 1} there is a set of order type α that is
homogeneous for f (if such a cardinal exists). In the notation of the
partition calculus, the Erdős cardinal κ(α) is the smallest cardinal such
that κ(α) → (α)<ω 

- Zero sharp was defined by Silver and Solovay as follows. Consider the
language of set theory with extra constant symbols c1, c2, ... for each
positive integer. Then 0# is defined to be the set of Gödel numbers of the
true sentences about the constructible universe, with ci interpreted as the
uncountable cardinal ℵi. (Here ℵi means ℵi in the full universe, not the
constructible universe.)

There is a subtlety about this definition: by Tarski's undefinability
theorem it is not in general possible to define the truth of a formula of
set theory in the language of set theory. To solve this, Silver and Solovay
assumed the existence of a suitable large cardinal, such as a Ramsey
cardinal, and showed that with this extra assumption it is possible to
define the truth of statements about the constructible universe. More
generally, the definition of 0# works provided that there is an uncountable
set of indiscernibles for some Lα, and the phrase "0# exists" is used as a
shorthand way of saying this.

12) almost Ramsey, Jónsson, Rowbottom, Ramsey, ineffably Ramsey cardinals

With [κ]<ω denoting the set of all finite subsets of κ, a cardinal number κ
such that for every function
    f: [κ]<ω → {0, 1}
there is a set A of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f (i.e.: for
every n, f is constant on the subsets of cardinality n from A) is
called Ramsey. 
function

13) measurable cardinals, 0†

- Formally, a measurable cardinal is an uncountable cardinal number κ such
that there exists a κ-additive, non-trivial, 0-1-valued measure on the
power set of κ. (Here the term κ-additive means that, for any sequence Aα,
α<λ of cardinality λ<κ, Aα being pairwise disjoint sets of ordinals less
than κ, the measure of the union of the Aα equals the sum of the measures
of the individual Aα.)

Equivalently, κ is measurable means that it is the critical point of a
non-trivial elementary embedding of the universe V into a transitive class
M. This equivalence is due to Jerome Keisler and Dana Scott, and uses the
ultrapower construction from model theory. Since V is a proper class, a
small technical problem that is not usually present when considering
ultrapowers needs to be addressed, by what is now called Scott's trick.

Equivalently, κ is a measurable cardinal if and only if it is an
uncountable cardinal with a κ-complete, non-principal ultrafilter. Again,
this means that the intersection of any strictly less than κ-many sets in
the ultrafilter, is also in the ultrafilter.

Although it follows from ZFC that every measurable cardinal is inaccessible
(and is ineffable, Ramsey, etc.), it is consistent with ZF that a
measurable cardinal can be a successor cardinal. It follows from ZF + axiom
of determinacy that ω1 is measurable, and that every subset of ω1 contains
or is disjoint from a closed and unbounded subset.

- 0† exists if and only if there exists a non-trivial elementary
embedding  j : L[U] → L[U] for the relativized Gödel constructible
universe L[U], where U is an ultrafilter witnessing that some cardinal
κ is measurable.

If 0† exists, then a careful analysis of the embeddings of L[U] into
itself reveals that there is a closed unbounded subset of κ, and a
closed unbounded proper class of ordinals greater than κ, which
together are indiscernible for the structure (L,\in,U), and 0† is
defined to be the set of Gödel numbers of the true formulas about the
indiscernibles in L[U].

14) λ-strong, strong cardinals, tall cardinals

If λ is any ordinal, κ is λ-strong means that κ is a cardinal number and
there exists an elementary embedding j from the universe V into a
transitive inner model M with critical point κ and
    V_\lambda\subseteq M
That is, M agrees with V on an initial segment. Then κ is strong means
that it is λ-strong for all ordinals λ.

15) Woodin, weakly hyper-Woodin, Shelah, hyper-Woodin cardinals

λ is Woodin if and only if λ is strongly
inaccessible and for all A \subseteq V_\lambda there exists a \lambda_A < λ
which is <\lambda-A-strong.

A Woodin cardinal is preceded by a stationary set of measurable cardinals,
and thus it is a Mahlo cardinal. However, the first Woodin cardinal is not
even weakly compact.

16) superstrong cardinals (=1-superstrong; for n-superstrong for n≥2 see
further down.)

In mathematics, a cardinal number κ is called superstrong if and only if
there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive
inner model M with critical point κ and V_{j(\kappa)} ⊆ M.

17) subcompact, strongly compact (Woodin< strongly compact≤supercompact),
 supercompact cardinals

- A cardinal κ is strongly compact if and only if every κ-complete filter
 can be extended to a κ complete ultrafilter.

- If λ is any ordinal, κ is λ-supercompact means that there exists an
elementary embedding j from the universe V into a transitive inner model M
with critical point κ, j(κ)>λ and
     { }^\lambda M\subseteq M \,.
That is, M contains all of its λ-sequences. Then κ is supercompact
means that it is λ-supercompact for all ordinals λ.

Alternatively, an uncountable cardinal κ is supercompact if for every A
such that |A| ≥ κ there exists a normal measure over [A]< κ.

18) η-extendible, extendible cardinals 

A cardinal number κ is called η-extendible if for some λ there is a nontrivial elementary embedding j of
    Vκ+η into Vλ
where κ is the critical point of j.
κ is called an extendible cardinal if it is η-extendible for every ordinal number η. All extendible cardinals are supercompact cardinals.

19) Vopěnka cardinals

Vopěnka's principle asserts that for every proper class of binary relations (with set-sized domain), there is one elementarily embeddable into another. Equivalently, for every predicate P and proper class S, there is a non-trivial elementary embedding j:(Vκ, ∈, P) → (Vλ, ∈, P) for some κ and λ in S.

The intuition is that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every proper class, some members are similar to others, which is formalized through elementary embeddings.

20) n-superstrong (n≥2), n-almost huge, n-super almost huge, n-huge,

- A cardinal κ is n-superstrong if and only if there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and V_{j^n(\kappa)} ⊆ M. Akihiro Kanamori has shown that the consistency strength of an n+1-superstrong cardinal exceeds that of an n-huge cardinal for each n > 0.

- In mathematics, a cardinal number κ is called huge if there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and
    {}^{j(\kappa)}M \subset M.\!
Here, αM is the class of all sequences of length α whose elements are in M.

21) n-superhuge cardinals (1-huge=huge, etc.)

22) rank-into-rank (Axioms I3, I2, I1, and I0)

In set theory, a branch of mathematics, a rank-into-rank is a large cardinal λ satisfying one of the following four axioms (commonly known as rank-into-rank embeddings, given in order of increasing consistency strength):

    Axiom I3: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of Vλ into itself.
    Axiom I2: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of V into a transitive class M that includes Vλ where λ is the first fixed point above the critical point.
    Axiom I1: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of Vλ+1 into itself.
    Axiom I0: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of L(Vλ+1) into itself with the critical point below λ.

These are essentially the strongest known large cardinal axioms not known to be inconsistent in ZFC; the axiom for Reinhardt cardinals is stronger, but is not consistent with the axiom of choice.

23) Reinhardt
In set theory, a branch of mathematics, a Reinhardt cardinal is a large cardinal κ, suggested by William Nelson Reinhardt (1967, 1974), that is the critical point of a non-trivial elementary embedding j of V into itself.
Not consistent in ZFC!
