=================================================

The Frattini subgroup Φ(G) of a group G is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of G. 

- Φ(G) is equal to the set of all non-generators or non-generating elements of
G. A non-generating element of G is an element that can always be removed from
a generating set; that is, an element a of G such that whenever X is a
generating set of G containing a, X − {a} is also a generating set of G.
- Φ(G) is always a characteristic subgroup of G; in particular, it is always a
normal subgroup of G.
- If G is finite, then Φ(G) is nilpotent.
- If G is a finite p-group, then Φ(G) = Gp [G,G]. Thus the Frattini subgroup is
the smallest (with respect to inclusion) normal subgroup N such that the
quotient group G/N is an elementary abelian group, i.e., isomorphic to a direct
sum of cyclic groups of order p. Moreover, if the quotient group G/Φ(G) (also
called the Frattini quotient of G) has order p^k, then k is the smallest number
of generators for G (that is the smallest cardinality of a generating set for
G). In particular a finite p-group is cyclic if and only if its Frattini
quotient is cyclic (of order p). A finite p-group is elementary abelian if and
only if its Frattini subgroup is the trivial group, Φ(G) = e.
- If H and K are finite, then Φ(HxK) = Φ(H)x Φ(K).

=================================================
Frattini's Argument. If G is a finite group with normal subgroup H, and if P is
a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then G = NG(P)H, where NG(P) denotes the normalizer of
P in G.

- Frattini's argument can be used as part of a proof that any finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
- By applying Frattini's argument to NG(NG(P)), it can be shown that NG(NG(P)) = NG(P) whenever G is a finite group and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
- More generally, if a subgroup M ≤ G contains NG(P) for some Sylow p-subgroup P of G, then M is self-normalizing, i.e. M = NG(M).
Proof: M is normal in H := NG(M), and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of M, so the Frattini argument applied to the group H with normal subgroup M and Sylow p-subgroup P gives NH(P)M = H. Since NH(P) ≤ NG(P) ≤ M, one has the chain of inclusions M ≤ H = NH(P)M ≤ M M = M, so M = H.
