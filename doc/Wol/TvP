To give you an idea, a standard 2 rax into expand build versus an expansion
non-allin build from toss looks like this: 2 rax into cc into 2nd gas into
eng bay into fact into starport into 3rd rax/3rd gas into 4th/5th rax into
4th gas into 3rd cc. You can only support 5 rax on 2 base and you had no
reason to get 2 starports blind.

==================================================
Max Standard TvP

1 rax expand (after 2nd supply if non scout, 1 if scouted)
(bunker at 3:50-4:00)
2 rax -> 2 gaz
tech lab -> conc -> stim
fact -> starport
tech lab + reactor on the two naked raxes
go up to 5 raxes into third
(Ghost acad @ around 11 min)

Adjustement: third gaz after stim started, fourth after starport started
             make ebay when building second tech lab
             8 minutes scout for 6 gates all in
             push out at first marauder to pressure
             marine scout for pylons at own third

10 Depot (~0:55-1:00)

12 Rax (~1:40)
  scout with this SCV once done
* constant Marines
* optional depot wall-in

16 CC (18 if depot wall-in; ~3:10-3:30) 
* get a very quick Depot so you donâ€™t lose production (if 1-depot expand)
* conditional Bunker @~3:50-4:00... if you CC the low-ground, Bunker
before Rax

21-24 Barracks, Barracks (delay by 1-2 food if you went for low-ground
Bunker) 

25-26 Refinery
(note: the 2 Barracks and Refinery [in that order] come up at ~4:20-4:40)
* at any time after this, you may scout Protoss 3 to 6 or 8 Gate pressure
incoming. If that is the case, you must drop additional Bunkers (at least
1, 2 in the case of the 8 gate attack). Dropping an additional Bunker to
make a total of 2 is an extremely safe play if you decide to do it
blindly and does not hamper the build.
* Tech Lab on 3rd Barracks
* checking for proxy pylons @6:00-6:30

Refinery (as TL completes/Stim starts, ~6:15-6:30)
* still constant Marines

Factory + Engineering Bay @100 gas (~7:00-7:15)

Refinery @ E-bay complete (~7:30-7:40)
* +1 Weapons

Starport + Reactor (Factory) @Factory completion (~8:15-8:30)

Barracks add-ons (Tech Lab, Reactor; ~8:20-8:30)
* begin Marauder production

Refinery (as Starport swaps; ~9:15-9:20)

Barracks, Barracks (~9:30)
* NOTE: these two Barracks MAY be built immediately after the add-ons for
the intial 3 Barracks are finishing. In order for the minerals to be
available, you must NOT have build additional Bunkers earlier in the
build (see previous notes).
* get 1 more Tech Lab, 1 Reactor as Barracks 4 and 5 finish
* push with bio + Medivacs @ about 10:15
