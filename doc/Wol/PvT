    9 pylon (chrono probes x3)
    14 gateway
    17 assimilator
    17 nexus
    17 pylon (at natural) -> scout
    17 core
    18 zealot
    warpgate
    stalker
  Holding 2 rax (5:50 pressure)
  1) You need to cut probes and add 2 more gateways around 5:00 minutes to hold
  a 2 rax. (eventually go 4gate for 4 gate pressure)
  2) 4cb on warp gate
  From your first gate build zealot stalker stalker sentry.
  Add 2gates without probe cut after queuing 2nd stalker.
  Chrono sentry out of 1st gate after 4th chrono on core.
  Warpin 3 stalkers.

  Timings: core start at 3:10, finish at 4:00, warpgate sans chrono finish
  at 6:40
  the attack is at 6:10 -> want warpgate done at 6:00 (10s to morph)
  (start 2 gateways at 4:55, done at 6:00, warpgate done at 6:10)
  -> 4 chrono

Comparison with MC super safe 1 gate sf timings (vs 111): 
nexus started by 4:50, 2 gates at 5:20, robo at 5:30
 (cloack first banshee, cloack done at 7:30, on xel naga arrives by 8:00)
 (=> with the 10s buff on obs, robo at 6:00 should give time for 2 obs with
 chrono: robo build time 65s, 30s per observer sans chrono)

# Parting 1 gate safer FE
=========================

9 - Pylon (CB Nexus 2x)
13 - Gateway (CB Nexus), Scout
15- Assimilator x2 (2 Probes in each)
17 - Pylon
17 - Cybernetics Core
18 - Zealot
* - @ 100% Core: Stalker (CB), WG Research
24 - Nexus
25 - Pylon
26 - Robotics Facility (cut probes for a bit)
26 - Gateway x2
26 - Sentry

Once safe and have your expo going and observer, next building is Forge for armor. Go from there as you like.

This bo seems strange, i like sase's one better:
9 - Pylon (CB Nexus 2x)
13 - Gateway (CB Nexus), Scout
15- Assimilator  (2 Probes in each)
17 - Pylon
17 - Cybernetics Core
17 - 2nd assim (2probes)
18 - Zealot, Zealot (CB)
* - @ 100% Core: wg
24 - pylon, stalker
expo@30/34, sentry
robo -> add 2 gates or the reverse depending on scout (but anyway they are
put down at almost the same time)


Transition: CreatorPrime PvT
============================
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=292549
  From the robo: 2 observers, then 2 immortals 
  7:40 Double assimilator at your natural
  7:50 Double forge
  8:40 Twilight council
  9:00 Add 3 gates
  11:25 Robo bay
  Take a 3rd
  Add 2 gates
  Templar archives

  10-12 minute double reactor rax, medivac timings: 
    - Startale builds: 3 -> 5 -> 7 gateways. 
    - Standard gateway timings for 2 base protoss: like 3 gates -> add 3 gates between 8:30 and 9:00. 
    - But for Creator build: too much tech (2 forges, 4 upgrades, twilight, blink, robo bay) -> 6gateways only @10:00 is too late
    Solution: 3 -> 4 gateways @ 8:30
=> FE -> 3 gate -> robo -> double forge -> twilight -> 
   4th gateway -> robo bay -> nexus/5th + 6th gateways
+ 3 sentries rather than 4; 1 immortal instead of 2


MC 1 gate fe into safe collo vs 1 rax fe PvT
============================
  9 pylon 13 gate 14 assim 16 pylon 18 core 18 z 22 pylon
  22 chrono stalker
  27 nexus
  2nd stalker, sentry next
  32 pylon, gaz
  add 2 gates
  add robo when 3 gates finishing
  1 z, 2 stalker, 1sentry: warp 1 z 2sentry puis 1sentry pour avoir 2z 2st 4sentry, warper pleins de zealots après
  les 2 gaz une fois le robo fini
  2obs 
  add 3 gates + robo bay
  immo -> collosses (3) (range dès le premier collosse)
  expo quand 2ème collose en train de se faire, et twilight council

Hero 2 base collo all in PvT
============================
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxkaCAzsgoU
1 gate expand (z, st, st, sentry)
(here he went nexus before core, 2ng gaz before stalker)
Take 2nd gas at 30
robo (before 2nd stalker) -> third gas (when robo almost done)
two gates
support bay (after first sentry)-> 4th gas
obs
collossus, range (chrono)
Warp 2 zealots 1 sentry (so 3 z, 2 st, 2 sentries)
3 gates
2nd collos
Two sentires -> 4 sentries, warp stalkers (and 1z) from 6 gates afterwards
Push @2nd collo (2nd collo finish @10:10, go out a bit earlier), warp prism
Warp 6z, attack
