medivacs out (@10:00)

1 rax gaz
Fact
reactor on rax after 3 rines
cc @22/27
starport, depot@24/27, tech lab on fact (-> switch)
2nd gaz (around the time starport is finishing)
banshee
2nd rax
raven (in case of cloack banshee)
tech lab on fact (-> tanks), switch starport with 2nd rax, start combat shield
3th gaz when cc lands, ebay
Add 2nd fact + 3th rax then 3th cc

Other version (against 1 rax fe, otherwise vulnerable to banshee): go
reactor fact and build medivac rather than banshee for hellion drop

Yet other version: Can transition into 2 base mech play: go 2 fact tech lab
+ 2 fact reactor hellions

Mech build
==========

gas first into blue flame hellion (switch with tech lab from rax)
cc after first hellion
starport -> viking
after viking: switch starport with tech lab from fact, switch fact with
reactor from rax, raven
build 2 fact: one switch tech lab from rax, one switch with starport
starport switch with reactor from rax (-> 3 fact: 2 react 1 tech lab, 1
starport with tech lab)
