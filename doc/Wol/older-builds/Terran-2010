  14 Refinery (build it with your 13th scv as soon as he spawns)
  15 OC + marine
  16 Rax
  16 Tech lab (first rax)
  ? Reaper (first rax) (I don't remember the exact supply mark - I'll check it as soon as I can)
  ? Tech lab (second rax)
  ? Supply depot (don't forget it)
  ? Reapers x2
  
  The timing is very tight, but if you get it, your 2nd and 3rd reapers will spawn at the same time (around 5:10) and no SCV will be delayed. I do a mineral walling to minimize SCV moves (it may be sensitive to early run-by, but that never happens to me). I scout quite late (at 13-14-15 supply, depending on my mood). Then you go, as soon as you can afford it :
  
  Two more rax
  Stim
  Marine shield
  
  Produce full marines + 1/2 maraudeurs. You may add maraudeurs if there are roaches. Make them only after researching Marine shield (maybe with the 1.3 you can afford a couple of maraudeurs before Marine shield, as there is now 50 seconds between Stim and Marine shield research time).
