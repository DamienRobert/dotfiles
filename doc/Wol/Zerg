  9 Overlord
  13 Spawning Pool
  13 Extractor
  15 Overlord
  15 Zergling
  16 Queen
  20 Roach Warren (latest you should start is when queen is 70% done)

  Zergling speed when you have 100 gas
  20 Overlord when queen pops, inject larvae
  20 drone
  Take drones off gas once you have 125
  Re-inject
  5 Roaches (Warren, OL, and injection should all pop very close to each other)
  Overlord (31/34 food)
  31 Drone
  Expansion when your roaches are walking to the enemy
  Re-inject
  Zerglings as you get the minerals, rallied to your opponent's base
  Queen

    10 [10] - Extractor trick
    11 [10] - Overlord
    11 [10] - Spawning Pool
    16 [18] - Queen 
    18 [18] - Hatch
    17 [18] - Overlord
    18 [18] - Overlord
    21 [24] - Queen
    28 [34] - Overlord
    28 [34] - Maynard 7 drones
    36 [42] - Overlord 

  So I have played a bit with this build in ZvP:
  11 overpool
  16 gas
  15 queen + ling
  18 hatch
  17 ov
  20 speed (take drone off gas)
  20 queen
  22 ov
  
  I don't really know if I like it or not. At 20 pop, you want to have speed, a second queen, an ov at the same time, and the first inject arrives. You don't have enough money to afford it all at the same time, so you have to waste larva a bit. The speed finish at 5:45, in time for a 4 gate, but you need a spine crawler against early stalker poke.
  
  So in the end, i really prefer
  14 pool
  15 gas
  18 hatch (you build a queen and ling before hatch if it is blocked)
  the gas is a bit earlier, and it feels more economic (of course I would need to test that rigorously).

vs 14g14p
  9 - overlord
  9- drone scout (this is personal preference ,
  I prefer to 9 drone scout in case they do some early pool builds)
  15 - hatchery
  14- spawning pool 
  17 - gas
  16 or 17 (your preference) - overlord
  as soon as spawning pool finishes throw down a roach warren
  and make 6-8 lings + 1 queen if its long rush distant maps, otherwise do 8 lings and wait for roach warren to finish..  If you want you can make a queen as well
  but delay the queen for a little bit to throw down that roach warren first.
  21-22 â€“ overlord

vs hatch first
  9 - overlord
  9- drone scout (this is personal preference ,
  I prefer to 9 drone scout in case they do some early pool builds)
  15 - hatchery
  16-18- spawning pool 
  17 - gas
  16 or 17 (your preference) - overlord
  Make 4 lings use 1 to scout
  21-22 baneling nest (incase they go all in ling)
  28-35 roach warren (If you think he's all in ling/bane make it as soon as you see it)

ZvsT: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=211960
  9 - overlord
  9 - drone scout (I do this to see if he's getting gas or 2 rax)
  15 - hatchery
  14- spawning pool (I do this at 16 if I do not see a 2 rax or see a gas / cc first)
  17-18- overlord (depending on if you pool on 16 or not)
  18-19 - gas .
  22-24- overlord (your preference)
  
  24-27 (your preference)- Roach warren.
  as soon as spawning pool finishes make 2 queens.  
  
  I make 6 roaches, 2 for defense, 4 for pressure.  The point of these 4 roaches is not to do damage or kill your opponent.  The point is to try to reveal his tech (lots of hellions, tank, banshee).  At the minimum you will probably force a bunker, but dont' sacrifice these 4 roaches unless you are guaranteed to be killing scv's and stuff, dont' let them die to a ton of marines, and if there is a tank pull back.  I get ling speed after I make the initial 6 roaches unless I need more roaches for some all in or something.
  
  32-34 - Sacrifice an overlord in your opponents base in attempt to scout his tech.  If you see tech lab starport you know to prepare for banshee, if you see a CC already done then you can drone super hard.  If you can't find anything you need to keep lings near the front of his base to determine expansion timing.  If they stay on 1 base to long expect banshee/blue flame hellions.
  You should be droning pretty hard unless you think he's doing some sort of early aggression or some sort of all in.
  
  I go lair after I take a third (unless I see banshee's or something).  So I take a third, take my gases, go lair, drop a baneling nest.  thats my order after the roaches while droning and what not.
  
  Put your baneling nest up with your next 100 minerals/50 gas.
  
  When you reach lair quickly start baneling speed..  If he fast expands you can take a third pretty quickly and be able to hold any sort of marine/tank push with a well setup flank.  Make a spire with your next 200/200 minerals/gas.  
  
  Start getting upgrades when you get your third with your gases mining (so 6 gas).  Do melee/carapace.

ZvsP:
  9 - overlord
  15 - pool/hatch (your preference)
  18-19 - gas (your choice, normally after spawning pool finishes is my timing)
  leave only 1 guy on gas after you start metabolic boost
  18-21 - third base (only vs forge expand, can be put down after protoss starts his natural read overview for a more detailed view)
  27-35 - Roach warren (this is very dependent on if he is 3 gate fe'ing/4gate if he forge fast expands make it same time you start lair)
  6:15-6:20 - make an evo chamber
  7:15-7:45 - start +1 carapace
  7:30-7:45 - put both drones back on gas, Get your 2nd gas at main, + 1 at natural
  8:00-8:30 - Go lair
