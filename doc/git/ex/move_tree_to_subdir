Yeah, I think it does (at least it makes sense to me, and worked on a
simple test case). I think I might use "git read-tree --empty" instead
of "rm", as it is a little more obvious what is going on. But other than
that, it is much more readable.

It is a slight shame not to show an "ls-files | update-index" example,
because that is the most general form. But since this form is quite
often cut-and-paste by people, I think simple is better here. If we want
to show a more complex example, then we should add it separately.
