- https://github.com/demian85/git-watcher #Git Watcher is a multi-platform desktop app written in pure HTML and Javascript using node-webkit. It shows diff information about local staged/unstaged files and allows you to commit changes. UI is updated in real-time by detecting file changes and git index changes. Submodules also inform changes to their parent module.
- https://git.csx.cam.ac.uk/x/ucs/git/git-repub.git #The 'git repub' command maintains a "repub branch" that you can use to record the history of another "rebasing branch" that is repeatedly rewound. Updates to the repub branch are fast-forwards, so they are convenient to publish.
