Mechanics
=========

Strength and Dexterity: Increase Armor by 1. Int: Increase resist all by 0.1
Vitality: Increase Life by 100.

Breakpoints: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/17346266764
frames_per_attack = floor(60 fps/(speed_coeff * attacks_per_second))
hit_rate = 60fps / frames_per_attack
60/(floor(60/(3*1.73)))*1.0

Proc coefficient: on things like life per hit so that spells that hit a lot
of target are not op.

Armor and vitality:
https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/240535/what-is-a-good-ratio-between-life-armor-and-resistances
https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/23gz1v/should_you_be_stacking_all_res_or_armor_an/
  Damage Resistance from Armor = Armor / (50*Level + Armor)
  Damage Resistance from Resistances = Resist / (5*Level + Resist)
  => Toughness = Health * (1 + Armor/(C*10)) * (1 + Resist/C)
       [C=5*Level=350]
     Armor equal to +100 all res = 1000 * (350 + Armor/10) / (350 + Resist)

Heuristic Ration: 
- CD:CC=10:1
- Armor:Resit=10:1
- 50% mitigation for each 500 Vitality over 1000
