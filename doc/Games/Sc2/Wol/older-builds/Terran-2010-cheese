Cheese: 1) 3Rax Supply-drop SCV + Marine cheese: Definition of an all-in
cheese. There is no coming back once you decide to prepare this cheese for your
main dish. If you thought 2 rax SCV was an all-in, wait till you see 3Rax all
in. Using the supply drop instead of a mule, you gain precious 20~25seconds
when executing the all in.

♤BO:
10- Supply (bottom of the ramp)
12- Rax (wall off bottom of the ramp)
14- Rax
14- Rrax
15- OC
17- (drop supply on the supply depot at the bottom of the ramp)

♤By lifting your 2nd and 3rd rax from above the ramp to below ramp, you can shave off 3-10 seconds on rush distance depending on the map. Generally, push commences around 4:00, and you want to keep the marines alive as long as possible. You only need to leave 2-3SCVs mining back at home. Bring as many SCVs as you can. Don't even bother setting SCVs on auto repair. Just form a nice cover wall in front of marines. Specifically designed to snipe 14 hat FE Zergs. On close positions, ultimate 14 Hat killer.
The reason why we get the OC instead of just throwing down another depot, is because:
i) your marine count will still be the same, as you're still producing off 3rax non-stop.
ii) you will only have ~2 more SCVs and ~130minerals short to support your reinforcements than when you build a OC, and you need the 2nd mule to support reinforcements in case of heavy resistance from your opponent.
iii) if you do severe damage to enemy (I.E take out his hatchery), it gives you to option to pull back, as I did in my replay #2)
But, if you know he won't be able to block your initial rush (16hat on steppes), building the 2nd depot instead of OC and bringing all your SCVs is risky, but faster way to end the game.

2) 6minute 3Rax Stim push: Not all 3rax
cheeses have to pull SCVs. Depending on number of SCVs you pull, this build can
be an extreme all-in to soft contain FE build. 4Gate? No problem. This build
crushes 4gate.

♤BO:
10- Supply
12- Rax
13- Gas
15- OC (Standard Terran opening up to this point)
16- 2nd Rax (2nd rax goes up as soon as you have 150 minerals, before the 2nd supply)
17- 2nd Supply
18- Tech lab (Tech lab goes up right after you produce 2 marines off first rax)
*As soon as tech lab finishes, make marauder and research stim pack
22- 3rd Rax (Build the 3rd rax as soon as the SCV building the 2nd Rax finishes)
22- Reactor on 2nd Rax
23- 3rd supply *(Stop SCV production at 19 SCVs, just enough to optimally saturate 1gas, 8minerals)
30- Tech lab on 3rd Rax
30- 4th Supply
*As soon as 2nd tech lab finishes, research Concussive shell

♤Pump 2 marines off reactor rax, and 2 marauders off tech lab rax. Push out around 6:00, depending on the map, so you arrive at enemy ramp right around 6:20. Your stim and shell should finish around 6:15. Save a scan for the timing push, so you can scan ramp before pushing up. Rally all units to enemy ramp, and bring scvs if you feel like they're necessary. Good against Protoss who sticks to heavy warpgate tech specially on close rush distances.

3) 4 PRaxy Cheese: By walling off early and skipping orbital command, you can support 4 nake barracks. Also, by proxying the 3rax outside, reinforcements arrive much sooner.

♤BO:
10- Supply at ramp (As soon as SCV is done building supply depot, send scout-1 to scout, and position it for idle Proxy location)
12- Rax at ramp
14- Build 2nd Rax (proxy) with scouting SCV near enemy base
16- Wall off with 2nd Supply (as soon as the SCV building the first Rax is done, send scout-2 out to proxy location)
18- 3rd Rax (proxy) with the 2nd SCV sent out
20- 4th Rax (proxy) (build it as soon as the SCV building the 2nd Rax (proxy) is done)
24- 3rd Supply

♤Constantly pump marines non-stop. It's crucial to not have your proxies scouted. The key to this build is to hide what you're doing. Stay outside of watch tower range, and bring all but couple of SCVs mining back in base. Depending on timing of enemy build, push happens around 4:50~ 5:15. There is no turning back from this. This 4proxy rax rush is even more of an all-in than the 3Rax supply drop rush, as you have no mules to fall back on.

                                    4) Proxy Thor rush: By putting the factory at a proxy location, we can compensate for the thor's slow mobility. In synergy with the SCV mass repair, thors can tank huge damage, not to mention how effective thors are in early game small numbers.

♤BO:
-10 Supply
-11 Gas
-13 Rax
*Depending on the map, send a scouting SCV around 1:45~2:20
-15 Factory (proxy) with the scouting SCV
-15 OC
-17 Supply
-18 2nd Rax
-20 Armory as soon as factory finishes, make 1 hellion from factory
-23 Tech lab on factory (proxy)
-24 Supply
-26 Gas (as soon as 2nd Rax finishes)

♤Constantly pump marines non stop from 2 rax. You can squeeze in a hellion while the armory is going up. Make thor as soon as armory is done. Pull 10-12 SCVs when the thor is 75% done. Use the mineral stacking glitch for SCVs to stack them when pushing up the ramp to bypass the thor and press S (stop command) to get a nice surround repair on the thor. Rally/move command everything to the thor, and focus on keeping the thor alive.

*In the replay, i don't get a hellion out, and that's because against Protoss, hellions aren't that good. I only squeeze a hellion out vZ.



                                    5) 4 Hellion Cloackshee tech rush: By always standing 1 tier ahead of your opponent, the hellion harass into cloakshee rush deals heavy damage to opponent's economy. Rather than calling this a cheese, this opening is a very solid harassment oriented opening. You can transition smoothly into mid-game, as having both reactor and tech lab, along with all 3 production facilities gives you the freedom to adapt and transition. Meanwhile, opening up with very fast 4hellions and transitioning into banshees, this double combo attack constantly puts your opponent under heavy harassment, and force him to tech in multiple tech trees in order counter both hellions and banshees. If executed well, you can safely expand and tech while harassing the opponent.

♤BO:
-10 Supply at ramp
-11 Gas
-13 Rax at ramp
-15 Wall off with Factory at ramp as soon as barracks is done
-15 Make reactor with Rax as soon as you have 50gas
-16 Supply
-16 Gas (right after OC finish)
*Swap Factory with Reactor on Rax and pump 2 hellions right away
-22 Starport (right after you que 2 hellions on reactor)
-23 Tech lab on Barracks
*Make sure you pause SCV production at 19 SCVs (23/27 supply with 2 hellions). Leave room for 2 more hellions (27/27)
-27 Supply depot
*Swap Starport with Techlab on Rax and research Cloak and Banshee

♤Taking a normal 4hellion opening, and adding on the Cloaking banshee as a 2nd raid, you can deal significant damage to enemy's economy. Both Hellions and Banshees excel at killing workers, and with the proper micro, can be very cost effective. Against Terran, use hellions to lower marine count, so the banshees can go unchecked. Against zerg, force as many lings / spine crawler as possible to slow down Queen/Spore crawler timing. Not so effective against Protoss.

                                    6) Proxy 2 Portcheese: Skipping straight to banshees, Banshee timing is extremely fast, opponent has very little time to prepare. Even if one does manage to deflect it, he is still tied up and cannot push out, allowing you to transition safely.

♤BO:
-10 Supply at ramp (Send scouting SCV right after done building depot)
-11 Gas
-13 Rax at ramp
-15 Factory (proxy) at close air distance to enemy with the scouting SCV
-16 Gas (as soon as OC finish)
*Do not build supply depot at 17/19. Cut SCV production at 16 SCVs. You will be capped at 19/19 for ~10 seconds, but 2 Starports should go up before putting the supply down
-18 Starport (proxy) at close air distance to enemy with the scouting SCV as soon as factory is done
-18 2nd Starport in base.
-19 Supply depot
-19 Tech lab on Factory (proxy)
-19 Tech lab on Rax
*Swap 2 Starports with Techlabs and pump 2 banshees ASAP

♤Make sure the proxy isn't spotted. Patrol marines at close air position against Zerg overlords. Against Protoss, float the factory (proxy) after done making tech lab, and send it around in a nice angle (do not give away proxy location) to check for robotics. If no robotics, get Cloaking ASAP, if robotics bay is already up and observers are out, skip Cloak, and pump Banshee #3,4 immediately (cloaking will be useless anyways). Against Terran, use factory to scout for turret positions, or even use it to draw enemy marines as a retard magnet. Invest minimum into defence (1-4marines depending on opponent's build), as it will slow down your banshee timing, but do not neglect to put up a bunker to defend if necessary.

  The idea of this build is to do enough harass, stall enough time to get
  your bcs up and running.

  -build core as soon as you push out, put up another starport.
  -tech lab on both starport

  PUMP out the first bc when you have enough resources
  -Push out with the first bc with banshee support
