---------------------- PvT 1 gate expand --------------------
kcdc: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=285834
  Many of you will remember this thread that arguably popularized 1 gate FE
  vs Terran on NA ladder. 1 gate FE remains one of the best openings that can
  be used in PvT, and a wide variety of 1 gate FE build orders are used
  which, for the most part, accomplish the same things.

  After testing many of the 1 gate FE build orders, I settled on the one that
  I thought was best and assumed that everybody used it. But it has recently
  come to my attention that this particular BO may not be popular, so I'm
  sharing it to win much admiration and glory. And to help less experienced
  players or whatever.

  13 gate -> scout
  gas
  pylon
  core

  This is normal. The core comes at 17 or 18 depending whether you use 2 or 3
  chronoboosts on probes, which is essentially a matter of taste. More on
  chronoboost use in a bit.

  zealot
  stalker
  nexus! (27 food if 2 chrono on probes, 27 or 28 food--map dependent--if 3
  chrono on probes)

  Here's where your scouting comes in. If you expect pressure, build your
  second gateway at 28 food, then start a probe, then a sentry. You'll see in
  the replay that I cut probe production for 5 seconds at this point. This is
  the only time in the build that I intentionally cut probes; if you see
  another time that my nexuses are idle, it's probably an error. If you don't
  expect pressure, you can get your 2nd gate after your sentry without
  cutting probes at all. If you don't know how to tell whether pressure is
  coming, it mostly boils down to whether you see T start a quick tech lab or
  a second barracks before his marine finishes. If you're in gold league and
  you're not sure, just get the fast 2nd gate. 5 seconds of probe cutting
  won't kill you.

  Build a zealot immediately after your sentry. This zealot, your second
  gateway, and WG tech should all finish at the same time (~5:50), at which
  point you warp in 2 stalkers or a zealot and a stalker total 6 gateway
  units which is plenty to defend a 2-rax without pulling any probes.

  Regarding chronoboost usage, using 2 chronoboosts on probes at the start
  times things up nicely because it lets you take your nexus at 27/34 and
  your second gateway at 28/34 without only 5 seconds of probe cutting. If
  you use a third chronoboost on your nexus before that point, it slightly
  extends that period, essentially wasting the chronoboost.

  On the other hand, if T isn't doing a heavy-pressure build, you don't want
  to cut probes anyway, so the third chronoboost isn't wasted. Season to
  taste. Both options work fine, but for purposes of really syncing
  everything up and giving you that nice timing where you walk down and blast
  through T's pressure, the 2 chronoboost option will make your replay look
  cooler.

  I'm favoring 3 chronoboosts on probes right now. I don't know exactly the
  difference on every map (it changes based on how far mineral patches are),
  but I still seem to be able to get everything out in time to deal with
  every push, although my first warp-in round finishes closer to 6:10 than
  6:00. It's still fast enough to defend 2 or 3-rax.

  In summary, this build slightly improves on my old
  zealot-stalker-stalker-nexus because it gets the nexus at 27 food, 175
  minerals earlier than the 30 food nexus. It also gets the 2nd gate much
  earlier (250 minerals earlier than a build that starts a third stalker
  before a second gate) which allows you to warp in 2 units right at 6
  minutes rather than one when you need it and another a little later. It
  also substantially eliminates the probe cutting that is common in 1 gate
  FE, makes use of the gas surplus you wind up with, and starts accumulating
  sentry energy earlier. I particularly like that the extra energy gives you
  the option of popping a guardian shield which helps a ton against the
  marine-heavy 2-rax.

  The downside is that you're sitting on zealot+stalker for a short window
  when you'd otherwise have a second stalker. This means that you need to be
  a little more careful against super-fast marauder pressure. Grab a watch
  tower or position a probe/unit so that you can see in advance if T is doing
  a 2 marauder push with 2+ SCVs. If that push is coming, grab 4 probes and
  attack him before the bunkers get planted. If you wait to engage until the
  bunkers are started, it's harder to control and your units will attack the
  wrong stuff, so I think it's easiest to just pull early and nip the push at
  the bud.

  The 2 marauder push with quick bunkers is the only one you want to use
  probes for. Even if you're going with the super-greedy transition I'm using
  lately (robo and 2nd assimilator before WG tech finishes), you can hold the
  reactor 2-rax without probes.

  If you want a more in-depth discussion of the strategy of 1 gate FE, check
  out my old thread. It's old, but it should be a decent resource for new
  players.

NrGmonk from MC: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=294136
  The following is MC’s version of the classic 1 gate fast expand. He uses it widely in his PvT macro games and transitions into a variety of strategies after. Various koreans have also done very slight variations of the build. This build, I believe, is THE safest, most solid variation of the 1 gate expansion. By cutting a few probes, skipping early sentries, and getting a fast robo combined with good reads, you will be able to effectively stop anything your opponent can throw at you. In addition to a 1 gate FE guide, this guide will serve as a mini early game PvT guide.

  When to do this build:
  This build is the safest version of 1 gate fe and thus can be done on any map. (Calm before the storm is a stretch though.) It’s also not the best build versus no gas 1 rax fe. Thus, if you can scout that your opponent got no gas, then I would recommend a different build. The build shines on a map like xelnaga caverns where aggressive builds like 1-1-1 and 2 rax dominate.

  Initial Build Order:
  9 Pylon
  *chronoboost probes
  13 Gateway
  *chronoboost probes
  14 Gas
  15 Pylon
  *chronoboost probes
  17 Core
  18 Zealot
  22 Warpgates
  22 Stalker
  *chronoboost stalker
  24 Pylon
  *chronoboost stalker
  26 Stalker
  *cut probes at 30 supply
  30 Nexus
  *Mandatory scouting poke

  Mandatory scouting poke versus gas builds
  This is one of the most important parts of the build and another one of many safety measures incorporated in the build. The fact is that with any 1 gate expansion build, you will need some kind of early game scouting to know whether to prepare for either bio pressure or later tech. The following is my particular favorite way to scout. Note that although MC has done this before, he doesn’t do so in all of his games, but he always scouts in one way or another.

  Push out with your first zealot/stalker towards your opponent’s base. At the same time, make sure you have vision between your units and his base with your initial scouting probe. This makes sure your main units will not get caught offguard. Now, poke up his ramp, leading with your probe. If you spot a marauder shot, a bunker, a large handful of marines, or his reactor timing on his barracks, do not continue with your units. If you only see 1-3 marines, however, use your zealot/stalker to attack up his ramp, either doing a lot of damage or forcing him to show you his units. The rest of your build will depend on what you see.

  Scenario 1: Marauder

      75% 1 rax tech lab fe, either marauder/reaper first
      10% 2 rax tech lab/naked
      5% 3 rax
      5% marauder/hellion push
      5% some tricky allin

  Rest of Build:- Hide Spoiler -
  30 Gateway
  30 Gateway
  30 Gas
  30 Stalker
  32 Pylon
  *Resume probe production
  ~34 Robo

  Scenario 2: 3+ marines with no bunker or already built reactor

      80% 2 rax reactor/tech lab
      10% 1 rax reactor expand
      10% other

  Rest of Build:- Hide Spoiler -
  30 Stalker
  *chronoboost stalker
  32 Gateway
  32 Gateway
  32 Pylon
  32 Stalker
  *chronoboost stalker
  32 gas
  *Resume probe production
  ~34 Robo
  As long as you macro properly, 2 rax should be easy to hold. Do not pull probes unless he pulls scvs.

  Scenario 3: Bunker or building reactor: no%s listed, because there’s too many options

      some variation on marine tank banshee allin
      1 rax reactor expand
      marine/hellion/medivac drop
      some other hellion opening
      2 port banshee
      2 rax 1 fact marine tank push
      1-1-1 expand
      3 rax bio based allin

  Rest of Build:- Hide Spoiler -
  30 Gateway
  30 Gateway
  30 Robo
  30 Gas
  *Resume probe production and chronoboost probes
  31 Pylon
  2 observers out of robo

  I won't go into detail about how to stop each of these possibilities, but there are 3 I want to highlight.

      Marine/hellion/medivac drop: If you do not have ~5 stalkers in proper positions by the time this hits, you will be in a lot of trouble.
      Marine tank push: This push hits at about 7:20 and cannot be scouted in time with an observer. Thus, you must have a probe/stalker outside of the Terran's base in case he moves out with marine tank. If you see this push coming, immediately cancel your 2nd observer for an immortal and chornoboost both your robo and your gateways, making nothing but immortals, zealots, and up to 2 sentries. Even with an exact response, this can be hard to hold.
      Marine/Tank/banshee allin: Refer to this for more info on how to stop this popular push.


  FAQs
  Why such a fast robo?
  This is the fastest robo in any 1 gate expand into 3 gate robo build I’ve ever seen. The reason for the fast robo is safety. Timing-wise, your 2nd observer will be popping out at around the same time as the first cloaked banshee comes to your base. However, more importantly, the faster your first observer gets to your opponent’s base, the faster you can know if he’s 1 basing you or has expanded. This scouting information is invaluable, as it tells you whether you should cut probes to optimally defend an allin or chorno probes to gain economy versus a expansion build.

  Why stalker as your 3rd unit?
  A 2nd stalker early allows for early game map control. The zealot/stalker/stalker combination will beat any unit combination the Terran can muster at the timing when the 2nd stalker comes out. The best army the terran can have at this point is marine/marauder/marauder, so if the terran overextends with a 1 rax tech lab or 2 rax tech lab/naked pressure, you will crush it. The 2 stalkers can also easily kite marines if your opponent is doing some type of marine allin or if he’s overtending with marine in a standard 2 rax. Finally, in general, the 2nd stalker just allows for much easier defense against any bio pressures.

  Why no early game sentry?
  The reasons for this are 2 fold. First, an early sentry from a 1 gate 1 gas expand is quite useless versus any early bio pressure. Secondly, if you skip an early sentry, you can get a robo out much earlier than most 1 gate expansion builds, adding to the safety of the build as explained above.

  Why always 3 gate robo and not 1 gate robo sometimes?
  Even assuming you somehow scout a factory in your opponent’s base, it is not safe to go 1 gate robo. Popular builds including reactor hellion openings and the 3 hellion/7 marine/1 medivac drop will decimate anyone who attempts to skimp on early gateways.

  Example replays/vods:
  MC vs Puma, IEM Cologne finals Game 1: vs 1-1-1
  - Hide Spoiler -
  Shows MC’s execution versus 1-1-1. Even though he eventually loses in this game, it is not because he couldn’t hold the inital 1-1-1 push. In this replay, you can see the general outline of how to stop the 1-1-1. He does it almost perfectly, but here are some things you can improve on to stop the 1-1-1.:
  No 3rd gas
  Faster 4th and 5th gates
  Cut probes earlier, probably around 36 instead of 38
  Try to flank with a few zealots/an immortal

  MC vs MVP, MLG Providence Game 1: vs 2 rax
  - Hide Spoiler -
  Shows MC’s execution versus the standard 2 rax. MC has one less stalker than is possible during the first push as his scouting poke is later than I recommend. However, with his probe poke, he sees mass marines, signaling either 2 rax or a reactor expand. Notice how even though MC confirms 2 rax, he still goes for an early robo as soon as possible. This is very useful as he scouts MVP’s 1 base play early and prepares accordingly for the allin.

  Also, I'm out of ideas for another guide so I'll take some suggestions.

  1) You need to cut probes and add 2 more gateways around 5:00 minutes to hold
  a 2 rax. (eventually go 4gate for 4 gate pressure=
  2) 4cb on warp gate
  From your first gate build zealot stalker stalker sentry.
  Add 2gates without probe cut after queuing 2nd stalker.
  Chrono sentry out of 1st gate after 4th chrono on core.
  Warpin 3 stalkers.

  Timings: core start at 3:10, finish at 4:00, warpgate sans chrono finish
  at 6:40
  the attack is at 6:10 -> want warpgate done at 6:00 (10s to morph)
  (start 2 gateways at 4:55, done at 6:00, warpgate done at 6:10)
  -> 4 chrono
  3) The build I tested tries to get out the same unit composition as MC's 1
  gate FE by the time the earliest 2 rax hits i.e. about 5:50. This
  composition is 1 zealot, 3-4 stalkers. The way to get this using this
  build:
  17 nexus
  17 core 17 pylon
  resume probe production
  Gateway when feasible by direct rally
  Stalker upon completion of the core, along with warp gate (chrono warp
  gate)
  Stalker and second gate should finish at the same time, make two stakers,
  chrono both
  Two zealots after the two stalkers, can chrono both
  Warp gates finish, with resource surplus, and no probe cut.
  You can add in additional gates in between this, and there is no need for a
  probe cut. This is just emulating the triple stalker opening from PvP.
  There are several v cool features of this build:
  1. No need for a 22 pylon, since the nexus finishes in time so that two
     stalkers can be queued without a probe cut.
  2. By the time the two zealots are queued, the natural nexus has 1
        chronoboost available, as does the original nexus. You can skip the
        15 chrono for an additional one on warp gates
