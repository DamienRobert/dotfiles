---------- Notes on 3 gates expo PvZ ----------------------------

Jaeger:

Just a few notes if you're plan is 3gate sentry expand,
Your core is ~5 seconds late.
You usually build a 2nd gas before zealot with this build.
Your sentry is ~13 seconds late because you don't have enough gas to start it on time.


You have several bumps in probe production because you don't have the money to constantly produce them.

1 second after gateway
3 seconds after gas
3 seconds after second pylon
1 second after core
1 second after second gas
11 seconds after warpgate tech
5 seconds after 2nd/3rd gateway

This might seem super nitpicky but as each chronoboost gives you an extra 10 seconds of production time thats over 2 chronoboosts of wasted production time.

So basically if you:
- place your core on time
- only chrono boost your nexus once
- constantly build probes from your nexus (this part requires pretty good worker micro actually)
- build a 2nd gas before zealot
- chrono boost out the zealot
- chrono boost out the first sentry

You end up with the exact same everything except you have an extra sentry and a second forcefield on your first sentry
