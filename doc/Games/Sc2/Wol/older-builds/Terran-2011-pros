Reactor Hellions

1 rax gaz -> 2 rines
depot -> fact -> depot -> 2nd gaz (same scv)
reactor (pull drones of gaz, prelift rax to reactor instantly)
cc @4:20, 21/27 pop -> drone back on gaz (when switching)
  (Thorzain put each new scv on the two gaz)
switch -> tech lab on rax -> make 1 new rine

1) Tank push

2nd rax
switch -> tanks
depot when first tank begin
siege @ 1.5 tanks
push @ 2 tanks with 3 scvs
=> @8min, middle of shattered temple, 33 scv, 4 hellions, 2 tanks, 13 rines

(Then build tech lab on rax and stim)

2) Fast 3 orbitals

stim on rax
lift fact and build 2nd cc
tech lab on facts -> tanks
4th depot @42/46
build 2nd rax on reactor
build 2 eng bay, take third gaz then fourth
add 2 rax + 1 fact (reactors on raxes)
starport, lift tech lab rax (combat shield should be finished) -> reactor -> switch with rax
third fact on tech lab from rax

Upgrades 3/3 @ 19:00
  (Depots: third by fact scv (22/27), Next is cc, Next is depot after tank
  started (42/46), Next is cc)

  Fact, switch with reactor on rax (make only 1 rine)

  My followup: Third cc while fact building
  Hellions + 2 banshees (attack at 2 banshees)
  2 armory
  2 facts -> switch tech lab -> Thors

TvT

1 rax expo (will serve as depot)
ref right after
rax, rax, bunker
tech lab on first rax -> stim -> third depot (@32/38)
fact -> 1 hellion to scout -> tech lab -> tanks
2 refs (one at expo)
eng bay
starport (with scv from fact)

New TvT build from thorzain
http://blip.tv/day9tv/day-9-daily-394-p1-terran-week-thorzain-s-tvt-5862954#disqus_thread

1 rax expand
2nd rax + 2 gaz (put only 2 scvs on each)
(build bunker with scv building cc, around when 2nd rax finish)
reactor on snd rax, tech lab (combat shield->stim) on first rax, third rax with scv from 2nd -> reactor
ebay (@6:30, when 3th rax is building reactor), fact (@6:45) (go for 3 scvs on each gaz, take third gaz)
starport (@8:00) (switch reactor from fact)
medivacs out (@10:00)
third after medivacs


TvP
===

1 rax expo (before 2nd supply)
2nd rax
2 gaz, bunker (only 2 scvs/gaz) -> bunker scv makes 3th supply @28/38
  (after eng bay)
reactor and tech lab -> stim
eng bay (@6:20, after 1ft rauder out)-> +1 (add 3 scvs/gaz after starting ebay)
fact (take third gaz -> starport (switch with reactor on fact)) + rax (when minerals) -> tech lab
(sometime Thorzain add third rax first then ebay and fact rather than the
other way around)

Push @2 medivacs:
  @9:30 86/86, 44 scvs, 2 medic, 5 rauders, 20 rines, +1 attack, stim
    (combat shield @ 50%)

Or ghost push:
Add 3th rax rather than ebay
ghost acad when tech lab from third rax finish
push @ 2ghost (with stim and combat shield)
when pushing add 3th cc, ebay, fact then take 3th and 4th gaz

2 rax push TvP
==============
 standard reactor then tech lab
 push @ first rauder, bring 3 scvs
 cc before stim @ 6:30


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% forgg %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TvZ: reactor hellion into banshees (cloak)
  expand, add two tech lab fact and drop blue flames hellions

  Look like MetroSG build; but more agressive opening; late expand
  Other variant by another GM: use hellions and banshee for quick third

TvP: 1-1-1 (with early push; so no raven or cloack; build tanks as soon as
first banshee building)

Or on Metropolis: 2 rax pressure into 1 base medivacs push
  So Standard reactor/tech lab 2 rax pressures (wait for 2nd marauder to
  push)
  Take second gaz early (after conc started) to have gaz for stim
  fact -> reactor starport

TvT: 1-1-1 (no reactor on rax), pushing with maring/hellions/banshee; like
polt

Boxer TvT

10 – Depot
12 – Barracks
13 – Refinery
@100% Barracks – Refinery, Orbital Command, Tech Lab
@100% Tech Lab – Constant Reaper production.
16 – Depot. Continue to make as needed.
@100 Gas – Factory (after one reaper)
@100% Factory – Starport, Constant Hellion production
@100% Hellion – Nitro Packs (Reaper Speed)
@100% Starport – Medivac
@100% Medivac – Tech Lab on Starport (Cancel if Banshee is scouted and make
a Viking)

Variation: only make 1 reaper and hellion, switch starport with rax for
cloacked banshee, make tech lab on fact for tanks, push

Demuslim TvZ stim marine push
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=319895&currentpage=All

He's basically pushing with hellion + marine at +1, stim and combat shield.
Here's an idea of the build (or at least what I'm doing trying to mimic
him) :
10 depot
12 rax
16 gas + first marine + orbital (yep, he builds one more SCV)
non stop SCV production
CC as soon as possible
push with the first 3 marines(and often 1 SCV, usually the scout) and stops
producing 'em,
fact @ 100
reactor on rax, doesn't switch, constant marines and hellion prod
adds 2 rax and an eng bay, tech lab on both barracks
all on ONE gas : stim as soon as possible, then +1 attack, and finaly
combat shield
all 3 upgrades finish at around the same time, and that's a SCARY timing.
He usually expands while pushing with everything, while at the same time
adding refineries and his starport.
Standard marine - tank - medivac from there.
