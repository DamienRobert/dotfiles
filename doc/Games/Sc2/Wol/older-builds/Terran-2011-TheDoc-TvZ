  15 OC
  15 Tech lab on rax, reaper @100% tech lab
  15 supply
  18 CC
  @100% reaper, lift off rax and make factory on tech lab at 19, only make 2
  marines out of floated rax
  21 rax [1]
  @100% factory, start either blue flame and helion or tank depending on what
  Z does. [2]
  @ Start of blue flame or tank, start 2nd gas.
  @ 4 marines total, make reactor on 1 rax and tech lab on another [3]

  Alternate Transition

  If you feel you are safe, because of late gas, you can also transition in
  to fast drops as so:

  18 CC
  20 Factory, 1 marine, then cut
  23 Barracks
  23 Barracks
  25 OC
  26 Stim and resume marine production
  29 Starport @100% make medivac
  31 Refinery
  32 Supply Depot
  35 Tech lab on Factory @150/125 make tank then tank and siege mode.
  @ float out, make refinery
  And so on. I have a replay doing this transition against LGZelniq on
  Typhon.

  Slayers Transition

  Best against: Late gas Z

  10 supply
  12 rax
  13 refinery
  15 OC
  15 Tech lab on rax, reaper @100% tech lab
  15 supply
  18 CC
  @100% reaper, lift off rax and make factory on tech lab at 19, only make 2
  marines out of floated rax
  21 rax
  @100% factory, start blue flame and helion production
  @100% CC, orbital command and then float to natural if not already there
  Constant marine helion and scv production
  @150/100, Starport
  @100% starport 1 medivac
  @100% medivac, push towards Z with marines, helions and medivac and add
  more production and gas.

1rax nogas FE, delaying 2nd supply

  16 1 marine, then cut until you start next supply
  16 CC
  @100 minerals supply, continue marine production
  @150 minerals rax
  @150 minerals double gas and then transition below

  SlayerS Style
  After CC, supply depot
  2 helions out of reactor factory. Do NOT suicide these unless he has no lings, no spines and drones just sitting there.
  Add tech lab on barracks
  Swap factory and barracks so factory on tech lab and barracks on reactor
  Start blue flame and constant helion marine SCV and supply depot production
  Keep helions around the map and float your 2nd CC after making it in to and orbital to natural if you didn't build it there.
  Add Starport at 100 gas
  @100% starport 1 medivac
  @100% medivac, push towards Z with your helions, marines and medivac

Transition (suppose we have 2 raxes)
Korean Transition (This one is my favourite)

  Good On: Larger maps
  Good Against: Delayed gas builds Fast muta

  The build, after a 2rax expand is:
  Constant marine, SCV and supply depot production (as needed) after CC
  24 Supply depot (or whatever supply you're at after CC)
  @150 minerals 3rd rax
  @75 minerals refinery
  @150 minerals 4th rax
  @75 minerals 2nd gas
  @150 minerals 2nd OC
  @100% 3rd rax tech lab
  @100% tech lab start stim
  Cut marine production a bit to add
  @125 minerals Engi Bay, continue marine and scv production and at 100% engibay start +1 Weapons.
  @150/100 factory
  @75 minerals refinery
  @100% factory, add tech lab to it, start starport and 4th gas
  @100% factory start tank
  @100% stim, start combat
  @100% starport, make medivac
  @100% +1 weapons, start +1 armor
  @2nd tank, siege mode

2 Fact Blue Flame
  Good Against: Speedling Expands No spine and no roach zerg i.e. greedy zerg Fast Muta Pretty much auto-win vs Julyzerg baneling pressure.

  24 Supply depot (or whatever supply you're at after CC) You won't need to start another Supply depot until after 2nd CC is done.
  Constant marine, scv and supply depot (as necessary production).
  @150 double gas
  @150 minerals rax
  @100% CC, start OC
  @150/100 Factory
  @100% 3rd rax, tech lab, swap with first factory
  @150/100 Factory
  After landing on tech lab, start blue flame and helion.
  @50/25 Tech lab on 3rd rax and @100% start stim
  Float out CC when you have 10-12 marines, you don't want to reveal helions if possible.
  Keep making helions out of both factories until you have 5-7 and move out accordingly. You can choose whether you want to go out really, it doesn't matter TBH and I don't know which is best so I just move out whenever I feel.

Tank Stim Push (Old but solid build)

  Good On: Smaller, closer maps.
  Good Against: Fast 3rd Fast Muta
  Countered by Losira style roach ling bane play.

  24 Supply depot (or whatever supply you're at after CC) You won't need to start another Supply depot until after 2nd CC is done.
  Constant marine, scv and supply depot (as necessary production).
  @150 double gas
  @150 minerals rax
  @100% CC, start OC
  @150/100 start factory
  @100% 3rd rax start tech lab to swap factory on to
  @swap, start tank production with siege mode. You want constant tank production until you push. Start another tech lab on 3rd rax
  @float out to natural, start 3rd refinery
  @100% tech lab, start stim
  @2nd tank, start engibay and +1 right away if haven't started before
  @50% 3rd tank, start starport.
  @3rd tank push out. Should have 3 siege tanks and a lot of stimmed marines.
  @100%stim, start combat
  @100% stim, start 4th refinery

  Note[1]:siege mode if you suspect any ling bane all in, else, you can get a fast +1 by adding an engibay if you know he's going to be droning (lots of spines made, or no/delayed gas).

  Float 2nd OC out after 1st tank if you lost your marines. If you retained your marines, you can float out earlier.

Reactor Starport (Jinro build)

  Good On: Shakuras Close air positions any map
  Good Against: Pretty much anything Z does besides below.

  Auto-lose Against:
  Julyzerg baneling pressure. If a competent Z is doing it, you will almost always lose. Be very careful this build. IIRC Jinro lost to Morrow's bane pressure both times.

  24 Supply depot (or whatever supply you're at after CC) You won't need to start another Supply depot until after 2nd CC is done.
  Constant marine, scv and supply depot (as necessary production).
  @150 double gas
  @150 minerals rax
  @100% CC, start OC
  @150/100 start factory
  @50/25 start tech lab on 3rd rax
  @100% tech lab start stim
  @100% factory starport and reactor on factory
  @100% starport, swap factory and starport and start 2 medivacs, start tech lab on factory
  @100% factory tech lab, start tank and siege mode and 3rd and 4th gas
  @100% stim, start combat and engibay and +1 right away
  From here you add your 2nd fact and CC as needed.

2 Fact Siege Tank (Auto-win close positions)
  24 Supply depot (or whatever supply you're at after CC) You won't need to start another Supply depot until after 2nd CC is done.
  Constant marine, scv and supply depot (as necessary production).
  @150 double gas
  @150 minerals rax
  @150/100 start factory @100% start tech lab
  @150/100 start factory @100% start tech lab
  Produce your 1st tank and siege mode along with more tanks. You want early siege mode because it's close positions and zerg will probably all in you. You also want to float to your main ASAP to get your additional gas income to support your double fact. No early stim or combat shields with this push. Move out at 5-6 tanks or as you see necessary, sack and SCV to see army size and composition or scan if needed.
