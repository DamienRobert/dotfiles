9 Pylon
13 Gate
14 Pylon
16 Gas ( mine only with 2 probes )
17 Gas( mine only with 2 probes )
18 Zealot
21 Pylon
22 Cybernetics Core

25 Second gateway
26 First stalker no Chrono

You spend 3 chrono’s on your nexus, so after first pylon finishes, 12-13 food probes and as soon as you have 25 energy again you chrono on the nexus again, 15-16 food probes. On 13, scout for the most obvious proxy locations ( i.e. shakura’s plateau in your base and in the middle between two naturals behind the bush ) to check for proxies.

4 Additional stalkers out of your 2 gateways and spend all your chrono on them to get them out Asap.
Once you hit another 25 energy on your nexus you chrono boost your warpgate tech once to have it finish up at the time where you will hit him.

At the 6:00 mark you have 400 minerals saved up to plant down a nexus. This is in the midst of your attack at the front so this requires a lot of multitask to get down correctly.

Do not cut probes for anything except your follow up tech choice after you get the nexus up. For example in case of a DT rush you need to cut probes for a few seconds to get the Robotics facilty ASAP.

As soon as you plant down your nexus put 1 extra probe on each gas to go up to the optimal 3 per gas geyser.

On a 4 player map you can scout once you put down your second gateway

Follow up:

Don’t be overly aggressive with your first two zealots and 1 stalker. This can result in your two zealots being picked off by a 3 stalker rush build and then you lose a lot of your firepower in your push. The 3 stalker rush into reactive 5 stalker build is the best way to “counter” this build because it can be hard to get a decent proxy pylon up.

If for some reason you cannot break him ( he has immortal out + sentry and it would be suicide for example ) warp in two sentries as you first units instead of 2 stalkers and delay him from getting out of his base. 3 gate robo can hit hard is you don't ahve the production yet so try to delay him as long as possible.

You need to get a proxy pylon up close to his base, and if you have a feeling you can kill him you also need to get on up at his ramp or even on top of his ramp. If he was too tech greedy you will damage him heavily while you get your expansion up safely. You have to pin him on his tech route with this aggression, or you have to play it ultra safe after you get your expo up. Your follow up tech choice will be dependent on what you see.

9 Pylon / 13 gateway / 14 gas

You’ll only put 2 probes on this gas

15 supply: Pylon
18 supply: Cybercore
19 supply: 2nd gas
19 supply: zealot
21 supply: 2nd gate then probe scout

After you make your 2nd gate, your cybercore will finish, start a stalker from your 1st gate right away.

25 supply: 3rd pylon (after 1st stalker)
26 supply: 2nd gate finishes, make double stalker (chronoboost both of them)
31 supply: 4th pylon (this could be a forward pylon that you can use later on)

At this point your 3rd and 4th stalker should be done and you can begin the pressure. You can bring a probe to fake a delayed 4-gate. Make sure you make a sentry directly after your last stalkers pops out and rally it to your ramp. Don’t forget to put an additional probe on your first gas.

You cut probes at 25 and add the robo as soon as you can afford it. While you’re doing the pressure, you can decide whether you should get an immortal first or the nexus. I think you should always get the observer before that though.

You will use your first warp-in for sentries to bring your sentry count to 2. With the 3 sentries, 3 stalkers and an immortal you will be in a good position to defend your natural.
