  vs 6 pool
  Forge whenever you scout the early pool
  (13 forge if blind into 17 nexus, 17 gateway 17 pylon)

  9 pylon (probe scout)
  Chrono x3 on probes
  Probe to the natural at 16 supply - just before 17th probe starts
  17 nexus
  17 forge
  17 pylon
  18 gateway
  19 cannon - chrono boost immediately after cannon goes down, 19th probe should not have finished yet
  * if you want to be greedy or if you just happen to scout that the zerg delayed lings to make faster queen or drones, then you can chrono boost before the cannon, and build the cannon on 20-21
  * (against hatch first: 17 pylon, 18 gate, 18 forge)
  19-22 probes
  22 double gas
  24-25 cybercore
  then i usually get a zealot around 29 and another pylon around 30-32

=======================================
Fast mothership
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=352585
FFE
- stargate right after c-core
- queue up 1 void ray and 1 phoenix, chrono stargate constantly
- throw down a fleet beacon after you queued up your void ray or phoenix
- while fleet beacon is building, add a few additional gateways (3 to 4)
- queue up mothership and constantly chrono, throw down twilight council after
- somewhere around here you will want to start +1 weapons, then +2, then +3
- add gateways until you have about 8 and take your 3rd or reverse these two
- when twilight council finishes, research charge and throw down templar archives
- make some archons and zealots, then throw down a robo facility for obs/warp prism
- now you're on 3 bases you want more gateways, I usually have 16 to 20 gateways when on a full 3 bases
- sit on your ass until 200/200
- a-move across the map like a boss. Creep, spines, broodlords, infestors etc. shouldn't matter

Creator Fast Upgrades and 3 base style
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=340185
  - Open with any version of FFE/ Nexus first.
  @ 100% gateway, cybercore. Make a zealot, and a Zealot/Stalker afterwards
  (both chrono'd). (Afterwards this gateway will only make sentries as WG is
  upgrading.)
  @ 100 gas, +1 attack
  (I won't go into too strict of chrono timings, but basically you want a few
  on +1/ WG/ initial units, but you also want some on probes early on as
  you're getting a fast 3rd/4th gas)
  @ ~44 supply / while 1st stalker is making, take 3rd / 4th gas. Chrono some
  probes to your nat at this point so you can maintain full saturation.
  - At this point, grab your 2 zealots/1 stalker/ a probe and send it to the
  zergs 3rd base (poke).
  @ Around 50% WG research or as your units are out pressuring, add on 3
  gates and a Twilight council.
  @ 100% WG research, warp in 4 sentries. Along with the initial sentries
  made from your Gateway, you will now have 6-7+ which is where you will
  stop and start making other units to defend your 3rd. Yes, you can
  afford all of these with +2/ robo units because you got your 3rd/4th gas
  so early! Thanks creatorprime
  @ Twilight completion / after initial 4 sentry warp in, Start +2 attack
  @Around 8:00, Robo. Shortly after add an additional gate in your main
  Once the Robo is completed, production is (100% chrono'd) 2 observers
  then Immortals until you feel you are safe from Roach aggression. Your
  first obs should go to his base/ rally point, and the next should patrol
  outside your 3rd base/ Natural area. This is to spot the roaches moving
  from your 3rd to your Natural so you can get in position with your army
  to FF. Very important on maps like Daybreak.
  @1st immortal queud, start blink.
  @ 8:20- 10:20, 3rd Base. You want to take it as early as possible. This
  depends on how comfortable you feel (ie, are there 20 speedlings outside
  your natural? Well in that case you will take it later because you have
  to warp in some zealots etc). The worst possible outcome is you take it
  too early and then get your sentries surrounded by speedlings, thus
  losing those crucial forcefields you need against Roach aggression. If
  you had decent timings though, you should have enough warp in cycles to
  get some zealots to protect your sentries and still get your 3rd at
  around 8:50!
  @ 3rd base started, Make two additional gateways and 2 cannons at your
  3rd base to create a sim-city, you want to create choke-poiints with as
  little resources as possible.. something like this: + Show Spoiler + --
  this is preference though, but you certainly do not want to fight
  max-roach with no sim-city.
  @ 3rd base Saturated, or upon scouting quick infestor/hydra or a quick
  4th base; Robotics Bay. After this is completed, you want 100% chrono on
  Colossus. You will delay this if your opponent is going for heavy
  max-roach aggression. Reason being you want to spend all of your
  resources on more units and robo time on immortals.. the delayed timing
  for the robo bay should start after 3+ immortals are out.
  Edit: @3rd base up.. check with your obs to see his 4th base. Did he
  take it? Now you can be GREEDY too, so get a faster robo bay (ie before
  your 3rd is fully satured, before a 2nd immortal etc) and make sure the
  Colossus/ +3 are started immediately and are chrono'd 100%. Because of
  this greedy play you can not only hit a more powerful max timing, you
  can choose to hit a <15:00 mark timing with a sub-maxed but 2-3 colossus
  +3 army. The advantage of this is you hit before a lot of spines can be
  up, less infestors are out, and broods can not be out.
  - At this point, you are safe on 3 bases and are well-saturated at each
  base. Stop probes, and only make Stalkers, and Colossus. Since you are
  safe, add on ~6 gateways to bring you to a total of ~14. These will
  finish in time for your max-timing.
  **@ +3 attack completed (start +1 armor afterwards), and 3 or more
  Colossus completed, start moving out. You should have pylons already
  completed out on the map somewhere (from your hidden probe earlier-on)
  and I personally make a warp prism as I move out. If no damage was taken
  mid game, it should be around 15:40 game time and you should be maxxed
  out as you warp in stalkers at the proxy pylons.
Summary: FFE, +1 attack, 2zealots 1 stalker poke
         3 gates + twilight (@50% warp gate) -> warp sentries up to 6/7
         +2 attack, Robo (@8:00) + 5th gate (and 6?), 2 obs -> immo,  blink
         third base @8:20-10:20
         Add 2 gates + 2 canons @third
         robo bay, go to 14 gates

Immo all in
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=346737
  Standard ffe
  +1 attack (done @7:45, then +1 armor)
  zealot, stalker, sentry
  robo@6:00, +1 assim, 2nd assim at nat when robo half way
  robo done @7:00 (like the first sentry, @around 40 probes)
  immo (chrono, no obs) (stop chrono probes)
  stop @45 probes (7:30, 22@each base+1 for proxy)
  add 3 gates @ 7:30, and 3 more @ 8:10
  move out @ 3 immos (9:05)
  77/84: 45 probes, 1z, 1st, 7sentries, 3immos, 7 gates, +1armor halfway
  warp prism, add 1pylon@proxy + 2 pylons
  first warpin: 4z, 5 sentries -> 5z, 12 sentries
