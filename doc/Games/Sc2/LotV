Notes
-----

Convergent points: 2 bases 3-1-1 into 3 bases 5-1-1 into 4 bases 8-2-1 or 8-1-2
Macro:
2 bases 3-1-1 from 1-1-1 or 2-1-1 or 3-0-0
3 bases: 5-1-1, 2 ebays
  follow up: TvT: 5-2-1 into 4th cc + 8-2-1 or 7-3-1
             TvP: 5-1-2 into 4th cc + 8-1-2

1 base all in: proxy four rax; 3 rax reapers
2 bases all in: 5-1-1, 1 ebay

Build notes:
- for 1 rax reaper, add a gas when adding the fact (except for hellions)
  add a gas after ebay
- supply depot: 21s, marine 18s, scv 12s
  => when building only scv, supply at 22/23 is ok
     scv + 1 rine => supply at 21/23
     scv + reactor rines => supply at 20/23
- refinery 21s, reaper 32s
  gas mining rate: 169.61gas/min=2.827/s, ie 100gas/35.4s

Reaper expand variations
------------------------

Standard reaper expand
14 - Supply depot
16 - Barracks
16 - Refinery
[17th SCV goes to scout]
19 - Reaper + Orbital Command
20 - Command center + reactor
20-22 supply

Variations:
- 2-1-1 => 2nd rax @ 21, supply + gaz @22, fact @23
- 1-1-1 => 20 supply, 21 factory, reactor on rax, 2nd gas
           21 supply if marine built before reactor
  Delayed 2-1-1: add barracks after factory+2nd depot+2nd gas
- 3-1-1 => third rax @23 rather than fact
- gaz first => factory@20 before depot@21/22

16 – Barracks
17 – Refinery
@100% Barracks – Reaper, Orbital Command and Factory
20 – Supply Depot (pull 2-3 Scvs out of Refinery)
@100% Reaper – Reaper or Reactor
@400 mineral – Command Centre (put the Scvs back in to saturate both geysers)

Summary (gas first => fact before depot, otherwise fact after depot):
2-1-1: rax gas cc reactor+rax depot+gas factory starport
1-1-1: rax gas cc depot factory gas+reactor starport
Gas first 1-1-1: gas rax cc factory gas+reactor depot starport
2 Gas 1-1-1: gas rax gas factory depot reactor cc
Delayed 2-1-1: like 1-1-1 but add 2nd rax before starport

@150 mineral – 2x Refinery
When you can afford – Engineering Bay (@100% – +1 Infantry attack) and 2x Barracks
Converge to a 5-1-1 with the standard three Tech Lab Barracks (research Combat Shield and Concussive Shell), two Reactor Barracks, Reactor Factory, and Reactor Starport. Produce the usual bio, Widow Mine, and Medivac.
Attack with everything you have when +1 Infantry attack is about to complete, which should be around 7:30. Again, some adjustments have to be made early on depending on Protoss’ build and decisions. For example, you can change Cyclone for Widow Mine.

Commence attack when the second Banshee appears. Pull some workers. Rally Siege Tank, Banshee, and Marine across the map for the push
=> @5:00 3 tanks 2 banshees.
The build itself is simple, but some adjustments are needed based on Protoss’ tech choice. A Cyclone is necessary against Stargate opening.
