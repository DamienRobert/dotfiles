Reactor expand into mine
========================

http://imbabuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvp/tvp-15-gas-fe-into-widow-mine-drop/
    10 – Supply Depot
    12 – Barracks
    15 – Refinery
    16 – Marine (up to 2)
    17 – Orbital Command
    17 – Supply Depot
    20 – @100% 2nd Marine, start Reactor on Barracks
    20 – @400 Mins, start 2nd Command Center
    20 – @100 Gas, start Factory
    @100% Reactor, start constant Marine production (build bunker here if you have not scouted your opponent expanding)
    @100% Factory, start Starport and Widow Mines (up to 2)
    @100% Starport, start Medivac
    When your first Medivac pops out (@7:10ish), drop your opponent with 2 Widow Mines and 4 Marines
    Benchmark: When that Medivac pops out (@7:10ish), you should have 29 SCVs, 12 Marines, 2 Widow Mines, and 1 Medivac

If you want to transition into Bio play, then get your 2nd gas, 2 more Rax, an Engibay, a Tech lab on your Factory, and a Reactor on your Starport.  This way, you can swap off your initial Barracks onto the Factory’s Tech lab and start Stimpack really quickly, start getting +1 attack from your Engibay, and get enough bio units – all to support a strong midgame timing.
(add 3rd and 4th gas to support reactor starport; add 2 more raxes then 3nd
cc and again 2 raxes)

1 Rax reaper expand
===================

    10 – Supply Depot
    12 – Barracks
    12 – Refinery
    15 – Orbital Command
    15 – Reaper, and pull 2 SCVs out of the Refinery
        You should now have 1 SCV mining gas
    17 – @100% Reaper, start Reactor on Barracks
    17 – @400 Mins, start 2nd Command Center
    18 – Supply Depot
    19 – 2nd Barracks
    22 – 3rd Barracks, and put 2 SCVs back into the Refinery
        You should now have 3 SCVs mining gas
        You can start an optional Bunker here if you feel unsafe
    @100% 2nd Barracks, start Tech lab
    Benchmark: When your Tech lab finishes (@5:35ish), start Stimpack Research with 22 SCVs at home, 6 Marines, and a Reaper
        Start constant Marauder production
    @100% 3rd Barracks, start constant Marine production off of the naked Barracks
    @100 Gas, start Factory, Engineering Bay, and 2nd Refinery.
    @100% Factory, start Reactor on Factory, Starport, +1 Infantry Attack, and 3rd Refinery
    @100% Starport, swap off Starport onto Reactor and begin constant Medivac production (4th starport?)
    Push out when your first 2 Medivacs pop (@9:30ish), you should have 47 SCVs, and around 18 Marines/3 Marauders with Stimpack researched

    10 – Supply Depot
    12 – Barracks
    12 – Refinery
    15 – Reaper
    16 – Orbital Command
    17 – After first 100 Gas is mined, stop mining all gas
    17 – @100% Reaper, start Reactor on Barracks
    17 – @400 Mins, start 2nd Command Center
    18 – Supply Depot
    19 – 2nd Barracks
    20 – Bunker, and put 3 SCVs back in the Refinery
    @100% 2nd Barracks, start Tech lab
    @100% Tech lab, start Stimpack Research
    @100 Gas, start Factory, Engineering Bay, and 2nd Refinery
    @100% Engineering Bay, start +1 Infantry Attack and 3rd Refinery
    @100% Factory, start Starport, Reactor on Factory, and 4th Refinery
    Benchmark: When you start your Starport (@7:50ish), you should be at 35 SCVs and around 60 supply.
    @100% Starport, swap off onto Factory’s Reactor, start 3 more Barracks, and start double Medivac production
(Note: add one barrack at the same time as starport, then 2 more rax)
    @100% Stimpack, start Combat Shields Research and begin Marauder production
    @100% 3rd Barracks, start Tech lab
    @100% 4th/5th Barracks, start Tech lab and Reactor
    @100% +1 Infantry Attack, start +1 Infantry Armor
    @100% 2 Medivacs (@9:45ish), push out with 2 Medivacs, 2 Marauders, around 28 Marines, Stimpack, Combat Shields, and +1 Attack.

ForGG Mech push
===============
Reactor expand into mine initial bo
Switch reactor with fact,
Make raven and add two facts
(so 1 starport, 2 fact tech lab, 1 reactor fact)
Reactor fact: makes =~6-8 mines then hellions
Tech lab fact: tank + hellbat research + mine research
(as sound as armory done)
Push when +1 and these 2 upgrades finishes

Thorzain Bio-Bat timing
=======================
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rvJNN6fgAA

Reactor expand build
1 rax gas (@15) reactor (@2 rines)
cc, *2nd gas (@20)*, fact (@21)
starport+armory (@28)
swap rax and fact, rax -> techlab -> stim (+ marauders)
two mines -> hellbat, starport -> medivac, do a 2 hellbats drop
continue hellbat drops (don't lose medivacs!)
ebay (@50% stim) -> +1
push (@stim done, 10:00) with 10 scvs, 4 or so medivacs, 6-8 hellbats, 8 marines, 4 or so marauders
meanwhile: add third cc, take 2gas at nat, reactor on starport, add two rax (one on reactor from fact)

Kop 4 fact 2 base timing

Another mech all in TvP
=======================

reactor expand (13gas) (1rine-> 1 reaper to scout)
fact -> reactor+armory -> 2 mines + hellbats
fact -> tech lab
fact -> switch with reactor from rax
starport -> switch with reactor from rax
fact -> tech lab
=> 2 reactor fact, 2 tech lab fact, 1 reactor starport
