A random variable X X follows the hypergeometric distribution if its probability mass function (pmf) is given by
    P (X=k)=(K:k)(N−K:n−k)/(N:n)
where
    N is the population size,
    K is the number of success states in the population,
    n is the number of draws,
    k is the number of observed successes,
    (a:b)={a \choose b} is a binomial coefficient.
