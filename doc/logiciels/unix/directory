sticky bit (1/t): only the owner of the file, or the directory owner can rm the
file (ex: /tmp)

setgid (2/s): new files are created with the group of the directory (and new
directories have the setgid bit set)

setuid (4): ignored on linux, on freebsd same as setgid but for the user owner
rather than the group

chmod ugoa -+= rwxXst/7777
