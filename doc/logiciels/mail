    Flag "R" (replied): the user has replied to this message.
    Flag "S" (seen): the user has viewed this message, though perhaps he didn't read all the way through it.
    Flag "T" (trashed): the user has moved this message to the trash; the trash will be emptied by a later user action.
    Flag "D" (draft): the user considers this message a draft; toggled at user discretion.
    Flag "F" (flagged): user-defined flag; toggled at user discretion.
