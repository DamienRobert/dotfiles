I don't understand why this is so complicated. There's two players involved, and it's always been this way regardless of the versions involved (at at least as long as the fsck hook has existed):

1) mkinitcpio offers you to option to fsck your root device before mounting it via the fsck hook. If you do this, you should mount root read-write via the appropriate 'rw' option on the kernel commandline. Historically, you mounted root read-only so that it could be fsck'd later on in the bootstrap. If root has already been fsck'd, why would you mount it read-only just to be remounted read-write later on?

2) systemd will fsck all filesystems assuming three things are true: the filesystem has a fsck pass number greater than 0 (either from /etc/fstab or a user-supplied unit file), the filesystem is not already mounted read-write, and you've not elected to disable fsck entirely via the kernel commandline option fsck.mode=skip.

In short, these are the only 2 logical setups:
1) Use the 'fsck' hook, use 'rw' on the kernel commandline.
2) Don't use the 'fsck' hook, use 'ro' on the kernel commandline.

Both of these options result in your root device being checked exactly once. The unlisted option 3 which most people seem to be running into isn't harmful (which is why it's simply a warning). Again, mkinitcpio is pointing out that root might be fsck'd again. mkinitcpio has no way of knowing for sure what will happen after it calls switch_root and it's only rightfully warning you that your config is strange.

===============================================================
Meaning of <dump> and <pass>

    The fifth field, (fs_freq), is used for these filesystems by the dump(8) command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped. If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.

    The sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8) program to deter‚Äê mine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time. The root filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1, and other filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2. Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware. If the sixth field is not present or zero, a value of zero is returned and fsck will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.
(Note: systemd only looks if fs_passno is 0 or not)
