fsck
====

There are two players involved:
1) mkinitcpio offers you the option to fsck your root device before mounting it via the fsck hook. If you do this, you should mount root read-write via the appropriate rw option on the kernel commandline.
2)systemd will fsck all filesystems assuming three things are true: the filesystem has a fsck pass number greater than 0 (either from /etc/fstab or a user-supplied unit file), the filesystem is not already mounted read-write, and you've not elected to disable fsck entirely via the kernel commandline option fsck.mode=skip.
Note: Option 1 is the recommended default, and what you will end up with if you follow the Installation Guide. If you want to go with option 2 instead, you should remove the fsck hook from
