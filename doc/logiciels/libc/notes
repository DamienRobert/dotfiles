signalfd: signalfd() creates a file descriptor that can be used to accept
       signals targeted at the caller.  This provides an alternative to the
       use of a signal handler or sigwaitinfo(2), and has the advantage that
       the file descriptor may be monitored by select(2), poll(2), and
       epoll(7).
