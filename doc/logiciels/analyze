 pv - monitor the progress of data through a pipe 
 perf - profiling:
   This is the wiki page for the perf performance counters subsystem in
   Linux. Performance counters are CPU hardware registers that count hardware
   events such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches
   mispredicted. They form a basis for profiling applications to trace
   dynamic control flow and identify hotspots.
