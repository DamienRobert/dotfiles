Add a task:
~~~ ruby
desc "Check that we can access everything"
task :check_write_permissions do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    if test("[ -w #{fetch(:deploy_to)} ]")
      info "#{fetch(:deploy_to)} is writable on #{host}"
    else
      error "#{fetch(:deploy_to)} is not writable on #{host}"
    end
  end
end
~~~

Example:
role :demo, %w{example.com example.org example.net}
task :uptime do
  on roles(:demo), in: :parallel do |host|
    uptime = capture(:uptime)
    puts "#{host.hostname} reports: #{uptime}"
  end
end

Configuration
-------------
http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/properties/

server 'name', property: value
Common properties:
    :user - the name of the SSH user for the server
    :password - for the SSH user
    :port - the port number of the SSH daemon on the server
    :roles - an array of rolenames
    :ssh_options - a hash of SSH parameters (see below)
    :primary - a boolean that indicates whether the server should be considered primary or not.

One can set a role + properties for several servers:
role :redis, %w{ r1.example.com r2.example.com r3.example.com }, redis: { port: 6379, master: false },

Filter
------
See https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/commit/5bae7fb40ca59d60a859400ec52c709c7686c387

ROLES=app,web cap production deploy
cap --roles=app,web production deploy
set :filter, :roles => %w{app web}

HOSTS=server1,server2 cap production deploy
cap --hosts=server1,server2 production deploy
set :filter, :hosts => %w{server1 server2}

Property filtering: http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/property-filtering/

One can match roles via
- roles(:foo)
- release_roles(...) #filter roles maked as release: false
- primary(:foo) #output the primary server for role foo (if none is specified then the first in the list)
These methods return a list of servers
- local roles filters: roles(:all, filter: :active)...

Note:
The external filters (ROLES, --roles, set :filter, :roles =>...)
only apply to commands issued: ie. they restrict the hosts that an `on()`
method will use, the will not affect the `roles()` method. On the other
hand internal filters 'roles(..., filter:...) will always apply.

Remote commands
---------------

http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/remote-file/
http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/ssh-kit/

on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do
  within "/opt/sites/example.com" do
    # commands in this block execute in the
    # directory: /opt/sites/example.com
    as :deploy  do
      # commands in this block execute as the "deploy" user.
      with rails_env: :production do
        # commands in this block execute with the environment
        # variable RAILS_ENV=production
        rake   "assets:precompile"
        runner "S3::Sync.notify"
        execute :rails, :runner, 'MyModel.something'
      end
    end
  end
end

SSHKit
------

The on method is from sshkit:
https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit
on(in: :parallel) { ... }
on(in: :sequence, wait: 5) { ... }
on(in: :groups, limit: 2, wait: 5) { ... }
cf [doc/ruby/applications/ssh]


Structure

- Capfile:
  # Load custom tasks from `lib/capistrano/tasks` if you have any defined
  Dir.glob("lib/capistrano/tasks/*.rake").each { |r| import r }
- 'cap' calls Capitrano::Application < Rake::Application
- setup.rb: required by Capfile
  Set up a task 'load:defaults' which loads "capistrano/defaults.rb"
  And setup a task 'stage' for each stage in stages which
  - set(:stage, stage.to_sym)
  - invoke 'load:defaults'
  - load config/deploy.rb
  - load config/deploy/stage.rb
  - configure_scm
  - I18n.locale = fetch(:locale, :en)
  - configure_backend (sshkit)
  => 'cap production' is a task that setup the necessary variables for future tasks, like 'cap deploy'
  Load ~/.capfile if it exists

Note: one of the top_level_tasks invoked is ':ensure_stage' which test that
the stage variable is set otherwise abort. This force to call 'cap stage
other_tasks'. This task is called if it is not in 
`tasks_without_stage_dependency=stages + default_tasks=%w{install}`
(cf application.rb#top_level_tasks)
`stages` is discovered by looking at the config/deploy/ dir
One can override this by setting 'set(:stage, "none")' in the Capfile
