To see all 256colors, cf 256colors.pl or the zsh version 256colors.zsh

How to have 256 colors in vim and screen
cf http://www.robmeerman.co.uk/unix/256colours
(I personally use TERM=screen-256colors for screen)
It contains the script 256colors_cube.pl which show a nice colorcube.

256colors.vim give the links between ctermfg and guifg. Comes from
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Xterm256_color_names_for_console_Vim
256colors_tohtml.py is a python script that convert it into an html page
(256colors.html) that we can see on a web browser

To see the colors in vi, launch vi and source color-demo.vim

xterm-color-table is from https://github.com/guns/xterm-color-table.vim
:source xterm-color-table.vim/plugin/xterm-color-table.vim
:XtermColorTable
(warning the color translation is wrong, 'df' should be 'd7')

16colors show the standard 16 colors on a terminal
