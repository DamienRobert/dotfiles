embed: embed a file in a pdf (like the source code)

navigator: Navigator offers access to PDF features such as outlines (book-
marks), links, actions and embedded files ; it differs from other
existing packages on two main points : first, it doesn't depend on
any format and can be used with plain TEX, LaTEX, ConTeXt (with
some limitations, see here and here), and anywhere else ; second,
it defines commands to create PDF objects, and can be used as a
base to produce raw PDF code across pdfTEX, LuaTEX and XeTEX.
