    Okay, so I'll walk you through this since there is really not a whole
    lot of documentation on the subject.  This assumes that your NIC is
    wlan0, your SSID is MyNetwork, and the password is
    SuperSecretPassphrase.

    You need to create a wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf.  So use wpa_passphrase
    to generate one:

    # wpa_passphrase MyNetwork SuperSecretPassphrase > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf

    Enable it so that it runs on boot:

    # systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0

    Now make a file at /etc/systemd/network/00-wireless-dhcp.network (it
    can really be named whatever you want):

    [Match]
    Name=wlan0

    [Network]
    DHCP=yes

    Now ensure that systemd-networkd.service is enabled.

    # systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
    [Rem: I think it is started by default by systemd]

    Reboot, and it should be working.

    Edit4: I forgot to mention that you also need to ensure that
    /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/systemd/network/resolv.conf.  As
    a hack (since I don't use systemd-networkd regularly) I have the
    following:

    $ cat /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/resolv.conf
    [Service]
    ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/ln -sf /run/systemd/network/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/rm /etc/resolv.conf
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/touch /etc/resolv.conf
