See TLP â€“ Linux Advanced Power Management
=> I use it for tlp stat (the rest [useful for me] is already in syst
powersave)
(cf powersave status for less informations)

Note: in powersave I don't unload wifi/bluetooth module anymore since
rfkilling them should be enough
Note the bluetooth.target is automatically activated/desactivated when bt becomes available/unavailable, so no need to stop/start it in powersave either

=> check if 'uvcvideo' (webcam) uses power
