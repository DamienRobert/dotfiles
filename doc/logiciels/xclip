zsh alias: XC = '| xclip -rmlastnl -selection clipboard'

* Options
   -i, -in
          read  text  into  X  selection from standard input or files (de‐
          fault)
   -o, -out
          print the selection to standard out (generally for piping  to  a
          file or program)
   -l, -loops
          number  of  X selection requests (pastes into X applications) to
          wait for before exiting, with a value  of  0  (default)  causing
          xclip  to wait for an unlimited number of requests until another
          application (possibly another invocation of xclip) takes  owner‐
          ship of the selection
   -selection
          specify  which  X selection to use, options are "primary" to use
          XA_PRIMARY (default), "secondary"  for  XA_SECONDARY  or  "clip‐
          board" for XA_CLIPBOARD
   -verbose
          provide a running commentary of what xclip is doing
   -r, -rmlastnl
              when the last character of the selection is a newline character,
              remove it. Newline characters that are not the last character in
              the selection are not affected. If the selection  does  not  end
              with a newline character, this option has no effect. This option
              is useful for copying one-line output of programs  like  pwd  to
              the  clipboard to paste it again into the command prompt without
              executing the line immideately due to the newline character  pwd
              appends.

* Exemples:
  $ uptime | xclip
  Put your uptime in the X selection. Then middle click in an X  applica‐
  tion to paste.
 
  $ xclip -loops 10 -verbose /etc/motd
  Exit  after  /etc/motd  (message  of the day) has been pasted 10 times.
  Show how many selection requests (pastes) have been processed.
 
  $ xclip -o > helloworld.c
  Put the contents of the selection into a file.
 
  $ xclip -t text/html index.html
  Middle click in an X application supporting HTML to paste the  contents
  of the given file as HTML.
