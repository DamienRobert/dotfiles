  - Graal: An optimizing compiler for the JVM written in Java with hooks
    available to interact with it from Java.
  - Truffle: A self-optimizing AST interpreter framework for Java. When
    paired with Graal it is able to perform partial evaluation on the
    interpreter and user program to produce tight machine code for the
    running application.
  - TruffleRuby: An implementation of Ruby based on Truffle. Since it uses
    Truffle, the runtime is authored in Java, but much of the core library
    is written in Ruby.
  - GraalVM: A distribution containing a Graal-enabled JVM and runtimes for
    Truffle-based languages (currently TruffleRuby, Graal.js, and FastR)
    from Oracle Labs. 
  - SubstrateVM: produce a static binary of a Truffle language runtime. The
    final output is a version of the Truffle language interpreter fully
    compiled to native machine code; i.e., there is no Java bytecode
    anywhere
