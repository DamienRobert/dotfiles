10 Supply Depot
14 Command Center
15 Barracks (can be on 16 as well)
16 Refinery
19 Marine (2x before Reactor)
20 Orbital Command x2
~  Bunker
21 Factory (right at 100 gas)
23 Reactor (right at 50 gas) (swap to Factory and then make a Tech Lab on
   Barracks)

Standard Follow-Up
==================

Command Center (you should have 3 CC, 1 Barracks, 1 Factory, 1 Reactor, 1
Gas, 1 Bunker)
*Start Reactor Hellions now*
Tech Lab on Barracks
Stim
2nd Refinery
2x Engineering Bay
2x Barracks (reactors asap) [soon after]
2x Refinery + +1/+1 + Starport (reactor asap)
2x Barracks (reactors asap) [soon after]
Combat Shields
*Should be establishing 3rd and adding a bunker at 3rd around now (~10:00)*
@50% +1/+1 get your Armory
+2/+2
Benchmark: At 11:30 you should have ~130-140 food if you opened CC First
and ~120-130 food if you opened Reaper FE
Your next moves will depend on the Zerg's playstyle but universally, you
will need to add the following items:
3x Barracks (Tech Labs)
Factory (Tech lab for Drilling Claws)
Command Center
