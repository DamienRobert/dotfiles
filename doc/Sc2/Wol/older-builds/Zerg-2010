1. 9 OL (10e if that's your style)
2. 15 pool
3. 16 hatch
4. 15 OL + Queen
5. 4x lings (you can make 2 if you feel confident)
6. Gas @ 18
7. 2nd Queen after 1st
8. Metabolic boost + roach warren at 100 gas
9. Stop droning at 34ish food (with 4 lings + 2 queens that's 28 drones)
10. You want to have 52 supply cap when your roach warren pops so I believe you need 2 OLs after you stop drones.
11. When roach warren pops you should be able to afford ~6 roaches (the actual # varies based on your hatch timing and other stuff). Make 6 roaches + rest lings.
12. Go up to 68 supply cap and keep pumping lings.
13. Attack with the lings + roaches!

Against 4 gate plays you want to cut back on drones a bit (so go to 26-32 food depending on if it's 1 gas or 2 gas) and make lings immediately rather than after your initial roaches. So long as you deny an immediate proxy pylon the force should be enough to eventually overcome the 4 gate. vs 5 gate you will probably also need spine crawlers (use them vs 4 gate as well if that's the way you roll).

------------------------------------ Axa's 9 pool ZvZ --------------
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=254591
9/10: Pool
10/10: 1st Overlord
10/18: 3 Sets of zergling
13/18: 1st Queen
15/18: 2 Drones
17/18: 2nd Overlord
19/18: 2nd Queen with extractor trick 1st larvae inject

First set of thoughts:
At exactly 3:23 in game time, is the time where you have to do 4 things simultaneously, within 4 in game sec:
-Produce another queen asap with the tight 150 mineral
-Produce an extractor, don't cancel it
-Inject asap as your first queen pop out
-Control your 6 ling and kill as much stuff as possible
In my previous thread, we had a controversy about 11/10 drone extractor trick. You can in fact squeeze another drone, but it will delay your 3rd zergling by a bit and quite mess out the timing. I tried the 11/10 trick for 2 weeks and i dropped 10% of my winrate or so, so i don't recommend it.

16/26: 6 Drones 2nd larvae inject
22/26: 3rd Queen

Second set of thoughts:
With your second queen, immediately plant a creep tumor to creep unto your ramp. Don't go asap with your 2 queens to wall off your ramp. Depending on the map and how your opponent managed your 6 initial zergling, you'll not be there in time and you can die to a large zergling counter. The safe way is to sit back in your base and defend in your mineral line until you get a third queen and creep coverage.

24/26: 1 Roach warren. Put 3 drone in gas 3rd larvae inject
23/26: 3 Drones
26/26: 3rd and 4th Overlord

Third set of thoughts:
When the 3rd larvae inject is done, you can finally go wall up your ramp. Be sure to put 3 drones in gas before making the roach warren, you'll see you can't do both simultaneously because after building your third queen, you won't have enough minerals left to do it for something like 5 more sec.

26/42: 4 to 7 roaches
36/42: 1 Expand
35/42: Lair
35/42: 2nd Extractor
34/42: Evolution chamber
33/42: 7 Drones
40/42: 5th Overlord

Fourth set of thoughts:
The amount of roach you'll have to do depends heavily on what your opponent is doing. I will talk later about scouting with overlord, but be sure to always follow this rule: If you don't see an expansion before yours, delay your Lair and your evolution chamber and make extra roaches, up to 7. The longer you don't see an expand, the more roach you'll have to make. Don't forget that queen tranfuse is the key to any all in. Let your roaches down the ramp in order to protect your currently building natural, but don't go too far and let your queen block the ramp until it's done.

42/42: +1 range attack upgrade
46/52: Roach speed and 6th overlord
52/52: Stop drone production, start Roach production with overlord.
84/84: +2 range attack upgrade

Final set of thoughts:
-Your expand should start at 6:10 and finish at 7:50 inject immediately and drone transfer
-Your lair start at 6:50
-Your +1 range attack at 7:40
-Your roach speed start at 8:15
-Your roach production start at 8:55
-Your roach timing move out around 10:20, as well as +2 range
You need exactly 32 drones in order to perform this timing well. It means 26 drones at mineral duty, 6 at gas. be sure to have no more than 16 drone at your main and around 10 at your expand to saturate them correctly.

15/18 Extractor: Mine 100 gas for speed and pull drone off.
14/18 pool
16/18 Overlord
16/26: 2 Queens, 2 set of zergling
28/28: 2 spine crawler, 2 evolution chamber. 5 set of ling to be safe against hellion run by.

Then 2nd extractor, pull back 6 drone in gas. Start +1 melee +1 armor asap.
Then tech to lair. 
T3 depends if you have 70 drone on 3-4 bases or not.
