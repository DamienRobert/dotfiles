2 rax pressure:
11 rax, 12 rax, 14 orbital, 16 depot

Standard hellion expo
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=272324
  10 supply depot
  12 refinary[as soon as it finishes put 2 on it for a total of 3 workers
   mining gas]
   13 barracks
   16 factory
   16 orbital
   16 supply depot [all in that order]
   16 reactor on barracks
   19 food switch factory on to reactor, produce 2 hellions and put tech
   lab on rax [incase you scout 1 base roach you need maruders
   instantly]
   24 food start command center
   scout with hellions and build two more.
   31 lift factory float over and make tech lab, build 2 barracks with
         one on the reactor.
   32 food starport + stim and add second gas[start combat right
      after stim is done]
   from this point you're going to want to drop your mule from
   your 2nd orbital and lift out to your natural and add two
   gasses and just pump non stop marine medivac tank
   your goal is to have 4 tanks, 2-3 medivacs, and roughly 30+
   marines.

  http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=274004
   An alternative to the OP build consists of getting a starport instead of
   the 3rd rax at the same time, grabbing your 2nd gas and getting a
   reactor on your factory. This gives you 2rax (1 reactor, 1 tech lab with
   stim on the way) and 1 port 1 fact. Once the port is up, swap with
   factory and you will have just enough for 2 medivacs.

  23 Hellion x2 (When these are done, take watch towers and make 2 more.
  Start harrass with 4 - VERY AGGRESSIVLY)
  32 Switch Starport to techlab and start Cloak resarch
  ** Cut hellion after the 3rd and 4th Hellion and SCV prodction for
  a short time to afford supply, cloak and banshee
  32 Supply depot
  32 Banshee 
  ** Resume SCV production
  36 Command Center (OC when done)
  36 Techlab on Barracks
  38 Banshee
  ** fOrGG lost hellions, will not continue with supply numbers but
  ingame time instead
  ** After 2nd Banshee, start producing Hellions again, dont forget
  supply depots/scvs etc!
  ** 9:20 - Fly Orbital Command to natural (Should have 2 banshees
  and 8 hellions if your first four died during the harrass the 8
  hellions should be able to clear out your natural of any lings
  trying to deny it)
  ** 9:40 - Build armory
  ** Lift Starport&Barracks, build 2 more factories on the now two
  free techlabs
  ** Keep repairing banshees if they get hurt, they should never die. 
  ** Be agressive with your hellions and just keep producing them.
  ** 10:25 - One medivac for Hellion drops!
  ** 10:40 - Two refineries
  ** When factories are done, get Blue flame upgrade and produce
  Hellions out of all three!
  -- It should be timed out that your 2 reactored hellions + your
  other two hellions from you techlabed factories and your medivac is
  done at approximatley the same time. Go hellion drop him!
  ** Get 2 Thors!
  ** Against mutaling (handful of mutas to harrass and a lot of
  lings), fOrGG seems to add a viking and more hellions before more
  thors.
  ** Against roaches, fOrGG sometimes adds a couple of tanks+siege
  mode+banshees. I've also seen him not do this and just getting more
  thors.
  ** Against heavy muta, more thors.
  ** Against heavy ling more hellions.
  ** Eventually he will always build more thors and push when he has
  3-4 and then he keeps producing them and reinforces!
  ** He also tends to add more banshees if Z switches to roach!

  18 Factory

  19 3rd supply depot
  21 2nd rax
  As soon as you swap the tech to rax, you make stim pack
  Make hellions as soon as factory is swapped
  Get tech lab as soon as 2nd rax is finished
  33 Supply depot
  You need have 4 hellions by 5:52
  42 concussive shell
  42 fifth supply depot
  You have 4 marauders by 7:05
  Move out with 10 hellions, 2 marines, and 4-6 marauders @ around 7:20 minutes mark!

  at this point you should be walled in. from this point forwards, don't build anything else at your wall unless you anticipate baneling aggression.
      18 Factory (can be 19 or 17 depending on losing scouting scv, how well you xferred workers to geyser)
      20 Refinery
      22 Supply Depot
      23 Starport (basically whenever your Factory finishes)
  At this point you have 4 marines. Unless you scouted an all-in from the Zerg, you now cut marines to afford your viking, thor, and medivac.
      25 Armory
  Use your first 100 gas after beginning Starport. hide this, it's the biggest tell of a thor drop. I patrol my marines to keep an eye open for scoutverlords. 
      26 Supply depot
      ~26 Viking when Starport completes
      ~30 Thor when Armory completes
      ~38 Medivac when you can afford it.
  Start producing marines again. Constantly produce Thors out of your Factory. When the Medivac finishes, add a tech lab to the Starport and constantly produce banshees. Add 2 more barracks as you bank up minerals and constantly produce marines.
  Your thor should pop at about 7:20, with your medivac popping a few seconds later. All in with 10-15scvs at 3 thors
