Standard TvZ is 1 rax hellion expand, but there is a lot of follows-up:

  10 depot
  12 barracks
  13 gas
  15 OC
  16 depot
  build 2 marines then stop
  18 factory
  19 reactor
  21 Command Center
  22 depot ( use the SCV that built the factory to make it )
  switch factory onto the reactor
  23 build 2 hellions
  27 techlab on rax

The bio centric build searches stim on the tech lab rax. The tank centric build
switch back after 2/4 hellions and search siege mode.

1) Standard (3 tanks push)
  4 hellions
  Stim
  Add two rax (one on the reactor from fact)
  => 3 raxes 1 fact 1 starport
  Starport
  Tanks+siege (construct new tech lab)

2) Fast drop
  4 hellions
  Add 1 rax only rather than two
  Starport (switch with new reactor from fact)
  
3) Bio centric
   6 hellions
   Marauders on tech lab rax
   Add two rax -> reactors (use fact to construct a new reactor)
   Starport (switch with yet a new reactor from fact)
   
4) Fast tank push
  2 hellions (switch back)
  Add 2 raxes (search combat shield)
  push@ 4 tanks
  (Faster push: build only one new rax, push @ 2 tanks, no combat shield)

5) Fast 3cc
  Build 3th cc after 4 hellions
  Switch back
  Tanks
  Add 2 raxes (tech lab and reactor)

The workflow is 
3 raxes (two reactor one tech lab) one fact (tech lab) one starport (reactor) 
- Agressive: Add 1 rax 1 fact when pushing
- Macro: 3th cc -> Ebay (upgrades!); Add one fact and two raxes when taking
  third (or 0 fact 3 raxes when bio centric) => 5 raxes 2 fact 1 starport

Late game: Add three raxes 1 fact and take 4th => 8 raxes 3 fact 1 starport

6) Mech
  2nd gaz when fact about to finish (after cc)
  Continuous hellions
  Starport -> banshee
  Armory
  Two fact -> switch with tech lab from starport and one made from rax
  => 3 fact (1 reactor 2 tech labs) 1 starport

===================================================
Max Standard TvZ

Std reactor hellion expo
stim on tech lab
add 2 raxes after 4 hellions (switch one with fact after six hellion)
put fact next to third rax to build reactor
ebay + 2nd gaz
starport + reactor on fact
third gaz
tech lab on fact
third cc

Remark: envoyer le 15 scv pour faire le supply, il fera la facto puis le 
        3th supply vers 20 (il y aura un petit supply block a 27/27)
        Il y a besoin d'un scv pour le supply de 35
- après les deux rines, ne pas produire jusqu'à ce que les 6 hellions sont
  faits -> rauders

10 depot
12 rax
15 depot to like 10% -> halt and scout (rax scv finishes) Or anytime before
   to deny scout, doesn't change the BO at all.
16 gas
17 marine
17 OC
21 CC at natural (once OC is done, make an SCV and rally it to natural
      400 minerals once it gets there)
23 factory
24 depot (start wall off)
25 rax
25 rax

      Go with constant scv production and 4 marines -> reactor. Keep
      scouting SCV alive. Check gas, and pool timing, then go to natural to
      scout for a spine if they make it. If they make a spine, move out
      with 3 marines to pressure with 3 marine 1 scv. If no spine, go on 4
      marines 1 scv. Kite lings (they're slow) and snipe any OLs you can.
      Spines are my priority, as they die very fast to 4 marines 1 scv.
      With decent control, you can get 1-2 drones, 3-4 lings, maybe a queen
      if they're sloppy, or maybe an OL.

      Once the 2/3 rax are done, one gets a tech lab other starts marines.
      Once tech lab is about 50-75% done, start ebay at wall of.
      Depot well before you need them to not be blocked.

      Constant hellions to keep map control, and constant marines to
      bolster your army. Start stim once tech lab is done, and 
      +1 likewise with the ebay. After about 15-20 seconds of starting plus
      1, start 2nd tech lab, and CS once it's done.

      Move out a bit before stim cs and +1 finish to establish map control
      if it's 'safe'. Most zergs now a days go multiple queens, and a
      faster third. This push shits on those 3rds, as stim/cs/+1 marines
      with hellion support rolllllllll zerg units early. I personally delay
      the push by a bit, and make 3-4 marauders to pick off queens, and
      spines faster.

      Once +1 is done, start +1 armor. When +1 armor is 70% start a 2nd
      ebay, and an armory.

      Start 3rd cc 70-80 supply, in that range.

      From there, get 2nd and 3rd gas, 2 more rax, starport, and 2nd
      factory. If they go ling infestor -> 2 factories start hellions
      constant with blue flame started. I have 5 rax, 2 tech lab, 3
      reactor, 6 marine/2 marauder/2 hellion cycles. With this composition,
      you can be out on the map sniping lings and forcing more lings = less
      drones.

      Once they establish a bit of order, tech lab 2nd factory, and get
      double factory siege tank production as you continue 5 rax, 2 fac, 1
      port production.

    http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=251694&currentpage=237

     I drop gas 2 and 3, get +1 armor, get starport -> reactor it, and then
     drop 2 more raxes, armory and 2nd ebay at 40% of +1 armor.

     I lift one of the tech lab raxes, and land the factory on it, the rax
     lands and makes a reactor.

     Start 3rd CC, then 2nd factory. That way, when third base is done, I'm
     on 5 rax 2 fac 1 port, standard marine tank with double ebay follow
     up. When third gets saturated, start 3rd fac, and 2-3 more rax. 3
     base, I aim for 7-9 rax, 3 fac, 1 port.

================== Post 1.5 patch builds ==================
11/11:
Send the 10th scv to proxy
Send the scv building the depot to proxy
13 scvs: orbitals
Send the 2 scvs building rax to scout+1 more + queue scv building second
depot to rally too (so 4 scvs in total)
Bunker rush
Build third rax at wall, 2 cc

3oc 1/1/1 opening
No gas fe
3th cc
2 gas
fact -> switch with reactor -> starport -> switch with tech lab
build 2nd rax (add reactors to the 2 raxes)
at 4 hellions+banshees add 2 eng bay

build raxes 3 and 4 to adds-ons (ie 1 reactor 1 tech lab)

Less greedy opening
No gas fe
16 double gas
17 supply
fact, starport, 3th cc after banshee started
double ebay
tech lab on rax: stim, add two raxes, starport go reactor for medivac
