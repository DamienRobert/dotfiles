# This is the list of trusted keys.  Comment lines, like this one, as
# well as empty lines are ignored.  Lines have a length limit but this
# is not a serious limitation as the format of the entries is fixed and
# checked by gpg-agent.  A non-comment line starts with optional white
# space, followed by the SHA-1 fingerpint in hex, followed by a flag
# which may be one of 'P', 'S' or '*' and optionally followed by a list of
# other flags.  The fingerprint may be prefixed with a '!' to mark the
# key as not trusted.  You should give the gpg-agent a HUP or run the
# command "gpgconf --reload gpg-agent" after changing this file.
